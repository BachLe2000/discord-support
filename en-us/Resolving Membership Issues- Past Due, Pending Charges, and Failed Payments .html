<h1 id="h_01HX06JJ3TNC38Y3HBCEQHF8P6">What does it mean when my membership shows as past due?</h1>
<p>When taking a look in your <strong>Subscriptions</strong> tab, you may notice that your <strong>Billing Information </strong>shows as <strong>past due</strong>. </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/23247418892567" width="487" height="411"> <img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/23247451165719" width="204" height="412"></p>
<p>When a membership is past due, it means that your membership renewal payment failed. This happens when a payment fails to go through on the renewal date. </p>

<p>If your <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000435108-What-are-Nitro-Nitro-Basic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nitro, Nitro Basic, Nitro Classic</a>, or <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028038352-Server-Boosting-FAQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Server Boost</a> membership is past due, you will have <strong>28 to 30 days</strong> to pay for your membership depending on where you signed up:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Desktop</strong>: 30 days from the renewal date </li>
<li>
<strong>Google Play Store</strong>: 30 days from the renewal date</li>
<li>
<strong>iOS App Store</strong>: 28 days from the renewal date</li>
</ul>
<p>While your membership is in the past due state, you will retain access to your perks for the duration of time listed above. </p>
<p>If a successful payment for the membership is not made before the window ends, the membership will automatically end and you’ll lose access to your membership perks and related streaks.</p>
<p>After you successfully make the past due payment , keep in mind that your next renewal charge may occur soon after depending on your renewal date. You can find your renewal date under <strong>Payment </strong>information in the <strong>Subscriptions Tab.</strong></p>

<p>There are several reasons that can cause a payment to fail. In order to figure out what’s going on, we recommend following the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensure that the billing address associated with the card being charged is current and matches the information filed with your bank. You can learn how to manage your billing information <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017693772-Payments-and-Billing-FAQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</li>
<li>Ensure your card details are entered correctly.</li>
<li>Ensure the card hasn’t expired.</li>
<li>Depending on the card, ensure there are sufficient funds in the account or that the credit limit hasn’t been exceeded.</li>
<li>It’s possible a pre-set spending limit on the card was reached. Double-check if a spending limit has been set.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="h_01HX071TNQWPE8ZCM2J01HQ9DG">If issues persist after following the steps, Discord's Support team cannot provide further assistance. We recommend contacting your bank or card provider for additional help.</h3>
<h1 id="h_01HX06JJ3TM4ERW2DMP4SFEFS0">Why does my payment show as a pending charge?</h1>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/23247418908823" width="452" height="516"></p>
<p>If you see a <strong>pending charge</strong> on Discord, this indicates that the charge was unsuccessful because it requires further verification from your bank or card provider. You’ll need to reach out to your payment provider for steps on how to correct this pending charge. </p>
<p>If the pending charge isn't resolved, it will automatically cancel within <strong>3 days</strong>. The status of the charge will then change to <strong>failed</strong> in your <strong>User Settings &gt; Billing</strong>. If a pending charge still appears on your bank statement, it should be removed within <strong>5-10 business days</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Q: I just paid for my past due membership? Why was I charged twice? </strong></p>
<p>A: After you have paid for your past due membership, your next membership renewal may be charged immediately depending on the renewal date of your membership. You can find the date your membership renews under <strong>User Settings &gt; Subscriptions &gt; Payment</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I cancel or change my membership plan while it has a past due payment? </strong></p>
<p>A: You can cancel your membership while it’s in a past due state by visiting <strong>User Settings &gt; Subscriptions &gt; Cancel</strong>. However, you won’t be able to change the plan you’re on until you pay for the past due payment on your current plan. Learn more about managing your subscription <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/19580873036695" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I redeem my Nitro gift credits while my membership is past due?</strong></p>
<p>A:  Gift credits cannot be used to pay for the past due membership. You can find out more about what happens to your membership when it’s past due <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/23082866222871#h_01HX06JJ3T7FGTGYNQCXNW7P9W">here</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Q: If my payment is not made on time, what happens to my perks?</strong></p>
<p>A: Depending on which platform you purchased the membership, you’ll have access to your membership perks for 28-30 days after your payment fails. If you do not make the payment before this window ends, your membership will automatically end.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Does my billing date change if I resolve my payment issues after my membership is past due?</strong></p>
<p>A: No, making a payment on a membership that’s past due does not change your renewal date.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why do I see multiple charges on my bank account?</strong></p>
<p>A: The only time you should see multiple pending charges are when your payments have not been successfully processed. When renewing a subscription and your renewal payment does not successfully go through, we will attempt the purchase again to ensure that your subscription goes uninterrupted. Once a payment successfully goes through, all other pending payments are canceled.</p>
