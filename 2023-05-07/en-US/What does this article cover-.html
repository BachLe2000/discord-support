<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communities are an essential part of Discord, and we’re making it a core responsibility for us to serve communities and create first-class experiences for both administrators and members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you run a community, you can now designate your server as a “</span><strong>Community Server</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">” inside Server Settings and get access to some powerful tools to help your run, moderate, and grow your server! </span></p>

<h1 id="h_01EEJW06BWCBBNNSM2SNW17GBW"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Requirements for Enabling Community</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to enable <strong>Community</strong> for your Discord server, you are required to have the following settings enabled in order to ensure safety in the community:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Safety Checks </strong>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Verification Level Setting</strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members of the server must have a verified email on their Discord account before sending messages or DMing anyone in the server. (Note that this doesn’t apply to users that have assigned roles!)</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Explicit Media Content Filter </strong> 
<ul>
<li>Scan media content from all members: this will scan all media sent in the server and delete any content that contains explicit content. However, you can mark certain channels age-restricted to avoid this happening. <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000084051" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn more about how to do this here</a>!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Rules or Guidelines Channel </strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">There must be a clearly posted server rules channel for members. This is useful so that new members understand what is cool and not cool in your community!</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Community Updates/Moderators Channel </strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the channel where Discord will send announcements and updates relevant to Community server admins and moderators, like new moderation features.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, you must agree that </span><strong>your server complies with our <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035969312" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Community Guidelines</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and that </span><strong>Discord may check the contents of your server to make sure it’s safe</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">! We want to make sure that users joining your server have a good experience and that there’s nothing that violates our Guidelines on your server.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="h_01EEK1ERA1EK6KPVEQ7VDW5GN7">Tools for Community Servers</h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043913591" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Welcome Screen:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></a>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set up a personalized welcome screen for new visitors of your server so they know what your community is about and where to start. This way, they can immediately head to the welcome and rules channels instead of wandering around lost.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360032008192" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Announcement Channels: </strong></a>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are special channels that enable you to broadcast messages beyond your server. Users can “Follow” your announcement channels and receive those updates directly to their own servers.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<strong>Direct Community Updates from Discord: </strong>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New features and changes from Discord can significantly impact your server. To help keep up to date, you can now select a moderator-only channel for official Discord updates. We’ll give you that heads up so you and your moderation team will always be prepared.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360032807371" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Server Insights: </strong></a>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Server Insights provides information about your server that can let you know how your community is doing. Is it healthy? Are people talking? What's your retention look like?</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360023968311" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Discovery:</strong></a>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can display your community directly on Discord’s Server Discovery — no more having to advertise somewhere else to attract new users! </span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><strong>Note: </strong>This is currently limited to servers with more than 1000 members and Partnered &amp; Verified servers. We will lower these limits over time.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</ul>
