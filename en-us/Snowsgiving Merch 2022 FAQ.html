<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Snowsgiving 2022, there will be fabulous, unique Discord merchandise available to purchase, with all profits from Snowsgiving merch going directly to support Crisis Text Line!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crisis Text Line is a not-for-profit organization that provides free, 24/7, high-quality </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">text-based mental health support and crisis intervention in English and in Spanish. Since  its launch in 2013, Crisis Text Line has trained over 55,000 volunteers and engaged in more than 7.5 million crisis conversations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supporting Crisis Text Line’s service through donations keeps the service free and helps </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a texter in need reach a trained volunteer Crisis Counselor. Investing in Crisis Text </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Line will also expand our additional programs that support research, workforce development, and higher education collaborations to address the largest systematic issues contributing to the current mental health crisis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mental Health support continues to be a focus for us here at Discord and we chose Crisis Text Line as a partner this year as part of our core belief to ensure Discord is a safe, inclusive place where everyone can find belonging. We had already established a wonderful partnership with them earlier this year that offers support in various regions in both English and Spanish - which made them a great choice for us to continue supporting the important work they are doing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can learn more about Crisis Text Line on </span><a href="https://dis.gd/snowsgiving22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our main Snowsgiving FAQ article</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><strong>High Varsity Jacket</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It comes in Light Mode. It comes in Dark Mode. It comes in handy when the weather is cold mode.</span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/10670961828503" alt="2022_Snowsgiving_MerchLaunch_LookBookInBlog_Jackets.png"></p>
<p><strong>Go Nitro Keyboard Bundle</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It won’t make you type faster or boost your WPM but it does look like it will which is arguably more important.</span></p>
<p><strong>Dice Set</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roll them once, roll them a million times, they’re dice, that’s what you can do with them. But not all dice are special Discord dice, so that’s nice.</span></p>
<p><strong>Nitro Dice Set</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A dice set, but just any dice set. IT HAS NITRO!!!!! Yes, that’s right. Nitro. Nitro Dice. They said it couldn’t be done, but we did it anyway.</span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/10670976945303" alt="2022_Snowsgiving_MerchLaunch_LookBookInBlog_Dice.png"></p>
<p><strong>Office Culture Skate Deck</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did you know the mural on this skateboard is also on the wall of our office? Pretty cool, huh?</span></p>
<p><strong>Snowsgiving Big Bundle</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s what you get: a hoodie, socks, a pin, a patch, and an air freshener. It’s the kinda bundle that makes you wish Snowsgiving didn’t come but once a year.</span></p>
<p><strong>Snowsgiving Small Bundle</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You want a Snowsgiving Bundle, but not the big one? Good, that’s probably why you’re reading this and for this bundle, you’ll get a camp mug, a pin and not one greeting card, but 3! WHOA!</span></p>

<p><strong>Wumpus Wheel Vinyl Figurine</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This lil thing is so dang cute. I just want to take it home and put it on my shelf and look at how cute it is. Dang it’s cute. Oh, description, yes, it’s a vinyl figurine.</span></p>
<p><strong>Nitro Wumpus Vinyl Figurine</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Wumpus needs to go fast, they bust out their Nitro jetpack and vroooom they’re outta here. Where does Wumpus need to go so fast? Still a mystery.</span></p>
