<p>You can lose your boosting streak for any of the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>You cancel your Server Boost(s)</li>
<li>Your Nitro (with 2 included Server Boosts) or your Server Boost(s) subscription has ended</li>
<li>The server you have been boosting has been deleted </li>

If you do not boost another server within 72 hours, you will lose your streak and our Support Team can not adjust your streak.</div>
<p>As long as you keep boosting your favorite server, that badge will continue to evolve while you reach extra levels. </p>

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Note:</strong> After using your Server Boost, you’ll need to wait <strong>7 days</strong> for the cooldown before transferring it to another server.</div>
<p>If you accidentally boosted the wrong server, or you just want to move your boost, you can easily transfer your Server Boost to another server! Just keep in mind, if you move your boost to another server, the original server might lose a server boost level. Here’s how to transfer your boost.</p>
<p>1. Head into your <strong>User Settings</strong> by pressing the <strong>cogwheel</strong> [<img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/29250546544791" width="23" height="24">] <strong>icon</strong>.</p>

<p>2. Navigate to the <strong>Server Boost</strong> tab.</p>
<p>3. Here you should see the current servers that your Server Boosts are applied to. Tap on the <strong>ellipsis</strong> [<img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/29250568257559" width="24" height="24">] to the Server Boost that you want to move, and then tap on <strong>Transfer Boost</strong>.</p>
<p>4. You can either search for the name of the server you want to transfer the boost to, or you can tap on <strong>Transfer here</strong> if you see the server in the list. In order for a server to show up in the list, you must be a member of the server.</p>
<p>5. Now just tap on <strong>Yes, Transfer Boost</strong> to transfer the Server Boost.</p>
<p>6. Finally you’ll see a confirmation message stating it has been transferred successfully.</p>

<h1 id="h_01JHNH8KCGP6EP1B8MGGBN7NTG">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<p><strong>Q: My streak reset and I believe this is incorrect, what should I do? </strong></p>
<p>A: Discord cannot restore streaks under any circumstances. If you think your streak was incorrectly reset, first verify that you have an active subscription.</p>
<p>If your subscription expired due to past due payments and you had to restart it, remember to manually reapply your server boosts within <strong>72 hours</strong> of reactivating your Nitro subscription.</p>
<p><strong>Q: My streak date appears incorrect. What should I do?</strong></p>
<p>A: The streak calculation differs between products: Nitro subscription streaks are based on the subscription date, while Server Boost streaks start from when you begin boosting a server. Since purchases use <strong>Universal Time</strong> (<strong>UTC</strong>), the displayed date may differ by up to <strong>24 hours </strong>from your local time.</p>
