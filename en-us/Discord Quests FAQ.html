<p><strong>Quests</strong> are a way for players to discover games and new content while earning rewards for playing, streaming, or watching videos on Discord.</p>
<p>Each Quest has a specific timeframe for acceptance and completion. Rewards are subject to specific terms. You can find the promotion terms for each Quest on the Quest Home page or after accepting the Quest.</p>
