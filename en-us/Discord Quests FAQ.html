<p><strong>Q: Why am I unable to see Quests on the Discord mobile app?</strong></p>
<p>A: This feature is only available on the desktop and browser app.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I have concerns or questions regarding privacy and Quests. </strong></p>
<p>A: ​​We encourage you to review <a href="https://discord.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord’s Privacy Policy</a> for further details about how we use your information.

<p><strong>Q: Why am I unable to complete Quest while using Linux?</strong></p>
<p>A: Currently, Quest rewards are unable to be earned on Linux devices. </p>

<p>Our support team does not have an exact ETA for when a solution will be available, and won't be able to provide any status updates on this specific issue.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I no longer see a Quest. Where did it go?</strong></p>
<p>A: Quests are typically only available for a limited amount of time. If you no longer see a Quest in the <strong>Gift Inventory</strong> or in-app notifications about the quest, the period to complete and claim the reward for the Quest is over.</p>
