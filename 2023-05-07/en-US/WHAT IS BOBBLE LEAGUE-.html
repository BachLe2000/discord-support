<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: Why is Discord adding games into voice channels?</strong></span></p>
<p>A: We started Discord because we are all about bringing people together around gaming. As Discord has grown, we've seen more and more people use Discord to come together around games. For instance, we’ve seen people use Discord to not only play <em>League</em> but also to hang out and play more casual, social games with friends like <em>Jackbox</em> and <em>Among Us</em>.</p>

<p>A: There is no age requirement for Bobble League.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: How do I play?</strong></span></p>
<p>A: To start a game, first join one of the voice channels. Once there, you should see the Activity Launcher (it looks like a rocket ship) in the voice channel controls. Click the Activity Launcher to open the Activity Shelf, and then select "Bobble League".</p>
