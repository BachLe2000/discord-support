<h1 id="h_01HGDZ419FVSEWZVPA2A2FF09V"><strong>What Are Apps?</strong></h1>
<p>Apps are created by Discord users and can vary from games to moderation to everything else in between. To learn more about apps, you can check out this article <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/9360431966359" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p>In this experiment, some users will be able to use apps in direct messages (DMs), group chats, and servers where the app is not otherwise installed.</p>
<p>If you’re an app developer and would like to learn more about apps on Discord, you can check out our <a href="https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Developer Support Help Center</a>.</p>
<h1 id="h_01HGDZ419F3ZD9FD14PEDNQMG6"><strong>Frequently asked questions</strong></h1>
<p><strong>Q: What is this experiment?</strong></p>
<p>A: Currently, apps are only available for use in servers if someone with permissions has added them for members to use. We want it to be easier for users to access apps, so we're experimenting with a way for users to add apps to their own account to use in spaces they're in across Discord.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I access this experiment?</strong></p>
<p>A: This experiment is currently available to only a small group of developers for alpha testing. Other developers and users will not be able to add apps to their accounts. However, you may see developers in the experiment testing out these apps within DMs, groups chats, and small servers. If an app is invoked in a shared space, you may be able to choose to interact with it there (e.g., by selecting a button or engaging with another message component you see from the app).</p>
<p><strong>Q: Do these apps have access to data about my server or DM,or the people in it?</strong></p>
<p>A: No, these apps are not able to access information about your server or DMs. They also do not have permissions to take action in your server or DM, other than sending messages. They also are not able to get information about members of your servers or DMs that have not used the app.</p>
<p>If a user does choose to interact with the app (e.g., through buttons and select menus), then the app can access their basic user information, like their username and <a href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/guild#guild-member-object" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">guild member information</a> (if in a server).</p>
<p><strong>Q: As a developer, when can I access this feature?</strong></p>
<p>A: We’re excited that you’re excited! Stay tuned in early 2024 for more information. We are continuing to iterate on this feature and are in the early stages of testing.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we frequently share product experiment news in our <a href="http://www.discord.com/invite/discord-developers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official Discord Developer server</a>, which is open for anyone to join.</p>
