<p>The Language Filter allows you to hide certain words from messages you receive on Discord, now in DMs, GDMs, and in servers. This filter can help you reduce exposure to offensive or unwanted language, giving you a more comfortable experience on Discord. It works by redacting detected keywords with asterisks (****) from a pre-selected library of words. </p>
<p>The filter is opt-in, and allows you to turn it on and off whenever you’d like. This filter only runs on your Discord client locally, meaning, this automatic filtering does not happen on Discord servers and Discord does not read your messages to power this filter. </p>
