<p id="docs-internal-guid-1f1e6c7a-7fff-d6b2-de6a-c3bec693fc51"><strong>Q: Who can currently access the Shop and buy and use profile effects?</strong></p>
<p>A:  The Shop is available to all Discord users. If you are also a Nitro member, you will have special member pricing on all purchases within the Shop!  </p>
<p><strong>Q: How do I get a discount on profile effects in the Shop?</strong></p>
<p>A: Only Nitro members have access to special member pricing in the Shop. You can find more information about Nitro <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000435108-What-are-Nitro-Nitro-Basic-" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Q: I already have a profile effect that is part of the Shop Bundle. Why can't I purchase the Shop Bundle to get the avatar decoration?</strong></p>
<p>A: Shop Bundles offer a discounted price on two items from the same collection. However, these bundles are only available if you haven't purchased any of the items included. If you already own one or both items, the bundle will be marked as partially or fully owned, and you won't be able to purchase the remaining item(s) at a discounted rate. In this case, you'll need to buy the remaining item individually.</p>

You can learn more about localized pricing <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/4407269525911" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. </p>
<div class="info-box">
<strong>Note: </strong> Profile effect gifts are not available at localized prices. Depending on a user’s region, they may be able to pay for a gift in their local currency, but the price will still be equivalent to the USD price.</div>
<p><strong>Q: Do I keep the profile effects I’ve purchased? </strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, any profile effects you’ve purchased are yours to keep and use anytime, even without an active Nitro subscription. </p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I refund a profile effect I’ve purchased?</strong></p>
<p>A: No, profile effects are non-refundable. You can learn more about our Refund Policy <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012668071-Refund-Policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.<br><strong>Q: Can I refund Nitro after buying a profile effect?</strong></p>
<p>A: No. If you’ve purchased a profile effect within <strong>5 days </strong>of your Nitro subscription renewing or becoming a new Nitro member, you will not be eligible to refund that Nitro subscription.</p>

<p>A: The Nitro exclusive DISXCORE profile effects can be freely collected by Nitro members, but require an active Nitro subscription to use. If you decide to cancel your Nitro subscription, the effects will remain in your collection but you won’t be able to use them.</p>
<p id="docs-internal-guid-b47eaca1-7fff-16d3-e1a5-daf0c4c8bbba"><strong>Q: Can profile effects be turned off? I don't want to see them. </strong></p>
