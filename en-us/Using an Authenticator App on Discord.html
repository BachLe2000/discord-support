<p>Using an Authenticator App (also called a Time-based One-Time Password or TOTP) is another great way to secure your account by providing a one-time code alongside your password - this ensures that someone can’t log into your account if they only have your password. You can set up an Authenticator App from your <strong>Account Settings</strong> on the mobile, desktop, and browser app.</p>

<p>4. Follow the instructions in the Discord app to copy your secret key into your Authenticator App so it can generate your one-time codes. You’ll be asked to enter one of those codes generated by the Authenticator App to ensure it’s working properly.</p>
<p>5. You can now link your phone number to your Discord account to help act as a backup method for obtaining these authentication codes). This can help you be less worried about losing access to your Authenticator app, but reduces how secure your account is.</p>
<p>6. After enabling an Authenticator App, the Discord app will also have a list of backup codes for login: each of these can be used once instead of a code generated by your Authenticator App, in case you lose access to it. Make sure to <strong>download and store these backup codes </strong>in a safe, easily accessible place! If you lose these, Discord can’t help you get back into your account.</p>
