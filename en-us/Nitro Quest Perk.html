<p><strong>Requirements to utilize the Nitro Quest Perk:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This benefit is exclusively for standard Nitro subscribers (not available for Nitro Basic or Classic).</li>
<li>You must have claimed the decoration reward after completing a Quest to be eligible for extended access.</li>
<li>Decoration must not have a listed expiry date.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="h_01JP5JECZD8212CV0DEPRCX5VF">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<p><strong>Q: Will I lose access to my decorations if my Nitro subscription expires or I downgrade to Nitro Basic?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, you will lose access to these decorations. Extended access to Quest-earned avatar decorations requires an active Nitro subscription. If your subscription expires or you downgrade your subscription to Nitro Basic, you'll lose access to the decorations until you re-subscribe.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I regain access to decorations from Quests I completed in the past?</strong></p>
<p>A: Not all past avatar decoration rewards are available - however, Nitro members can access most decorations they previously earned by completing Quests and claiming the rewards.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Do I need to complete the Quest again to get the decoration back?</strong><br>A: No. If you previously completed the Quest and claimed the reward, you'll automatically regain access to eligible decorations when you subscribe to Nitro.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How do I know how long I can keep a Quest-earned avatar decoration?</strong></p>
<p>A: Most Quest-earned avatar decorations are yours to use with your Discord account. If an avatar decoration has a specific expiry date, you’ll see the expiry date listed under the specific avatar decoration in <strong>Profile Settings &gt; Change Decoration</strong>.</p>
