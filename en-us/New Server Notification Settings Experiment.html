<h1 id="h_01HNNXQ6T226GDK5830TH563D9">What is the new notification feature?</h1>
<h3 id="h_01HNNXQ6T2RKJPP1TYTTW8RYRW"><span style="color: #434343;">This is currently an experiment and not available to everyone.</span></h3>
<p>It can be pretty overwhelming when you join a new community, especially if the server has a lot of active channels. Any time someone sends a message, Discord shows a little white dot next to the channel and server to let you know a new message has been sent.</p>
<p>It can be information overload, and so naturally you take the only action you can and mute the server. Problem solved, right?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it becomes harder to pay attention to the 1 or 2 channels you really like on that specific server. You start missing out on moments because it’s muted. You have to try to remember to go back to that server and check those specific channels. But what if you forget? </p>
<p>If this sounds familiar, we have good news! Discord is introducing a “middle ground” setting between “show me everything” and “show me nothing”. Let’s go over this setting a little bit more.</p>

<h3 id="h_01HNNXQ6T25RJ9DM6RFVHDESSQ"><span style="color: #434343;">This experiment is available on both the desktop and mobile app, however, the below modal will only pop-up in the desktop app.</span></h3>
<p>If this experimental feature becomes available to you, Discord will help you get started by showing this modal the next time you launch Discord.</p>
<p>Just follow the prompts and select which servers have the most important updates for you!</p>

<p>It will also help explain what has changed and give you a chance to pick and choose some servers that you want to try this feature out on right away. </p>
<p>We recommend trying it on servers that might overwhelm you, but have channels you’re interested in.</p>
<h2 id="h_01HNNXQ6T2YFE1F7MYV75QA4HV">Notification Settings</h2>
<p>Let’s go over how this feature affects each type of notification setting and then how to set a Custom setting on both desktop and mobile.</p>
<p><strong>All Messages</strong>: When someone sends you a message in a channel that is set to <strong>All Messages</strong>, everything will behave exactly like before: The channel is highlighted in white, and both the channel and server show a little white dot next to them.</p>
<p>You will also continue to receive a notification for each new message in the channel.</p>
<p><strong>@Mentions</strong> (a.k.a. Only Mentions): When someone sends you a message in a channel that is set to <strong>@Mentions</strong>, the channel is not highlighted. Instead the channel stays the same color, and shows a light gray dot next to it. It gives you a hint of activity, but doesn’t try to compel you to check in on the channel. </p>
<p>Most importantly the server does not show a white or gray dot at all! This allows you to check these channels on your own schedule, instead of being nagged to check them right away.</p>
<p>If someone mentions you in this channel though, the channel will be highlighted in white, and both the server and channel will have a red badge so you know something important happened.</p>
<p>You will also continue to receive a notification for each new message that mentions you in the channel.</p>
<p><strong>Nothing: </strong>When someone sends you a message in a channel that is set to “Nothing”, the channel and server will behave the same way as @Mentions, however you will never receive a notification from this channel.</p>
<p><strong>Desktop</strong></p>
<p>1. Navigate to the server you want to adjust the settings for.</p>
<p>2. Right-click on the channel and then navigate to <strong>Notifications</strong> and then tap on <strong>Custom.</strong></p>

<p>If you select the <strong>Custom</strong> option, this allows you to change each behavior independently, such as how should Discord display that there are new messages and when should Discord notify you.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile</strong></p>
<p>1. Navigate to the server you want to adjust the settings for.</p>
<p>2. Long press on the channel you want to adjust the settings for then tap on <strong>Notification Settings</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Here you can customize your notification settings for this channel.</p>

<h1 id="h_01HNNXQ6T27Q8S6MSRZ5P53J2H">When should I use this specific notification setting?</h1>
<p>This setting is best for larger, busy servers and channels where you may prefer to check them on your own schedule. Instead of muting them, now you can pick and choose the channels you care about most, without being notified to visit the other channels. It’s like a better way of muting! This setting allows you to ignore everything by default while picking the specific channels you care about in a server.</p>
<p>For example: Do you want to know when there’s a new update to a game you play or an update to an app you use? You can set that server to <strong>Mentions Only</strong>, and then  select the channel with release announcements to <strong>All Messages</strong>! Now you’ll get notified about that one channel, without getting overwhelmed by the rest of the server.</p>
<h1 id="h_01HNNXQ6T2EA493Y2Y4HFXZPNP">How do I turn this feature off?</h1>
<h3 id="h_01HNNXQ6T2F8Y8CZKACQJT1YDF"><span style="color: #434343;">The option to disable this feature is only on the desktop app.</span></h3>
