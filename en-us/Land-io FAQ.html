<h1 id="h_01FYWWNGTFY94TKW46M75TEHF5"><strong>WHAT IS LAND-IO?</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/4422142836759" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Land-io</a>, players claim territory by moving around, making trails, and enclosing plots of land to gain them as their own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal is to have the most land claimed when game time runs out, but watch out for other players! If someone runs into your trail, you'll lose all the land you've collected."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The player with the most land at the end of the 5 minutes wins the game.</span></p>

<p>1. To get started, be sure to choose between a <strong>Public Game</strong> or <strong>Private</strong> <strong>Game</strong> by selecting the toggle in the bottom-right corner. For this example, we will be playing a <strong>Private</strong> <strong>Game</strong>. </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><strong><span id="docs-internal-guid-82065310-7fff-424b-94d4-9bfb63114624"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/21807140994199" width="600" height="337"></span></strong></p>

By default your username and avatar will be anonymized, assigning a character image and name to display in game. If you’d like to change this setting, you can toggle the Play Anonymously option located near the upper-right corner of the homepage.</span></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span id="docs-internal-guid-80e24ecc-7fff-28a4-ef61-e554bc6217a8"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/21807141005591" width="624" height="351"></span></p>
<p id="docs-internal-guid-09407e0e-7fff-72a3-e243-105d9e03e025">2.  Once you have chosen which type of game you would like to play, choose an <strong>element</strong> and select <strong>Join</strong>. Elements are randomized upon entering the game’s homepage. For this example, we will be using <strong>Water</strong>. Elements are for cool points only, they don’t affect gameplay!</p>
<p>After joining, you will be brought to the map where you can use <strong>WASD keys</strong>, the <strong>arrow</strong> <strong>keys</strong>, or <strong>click and drag with your mouse</strong> (dragging your finger on mobile devices) to move away from your land to start a trail. If you’d like to stop moving your element, press the <strong>spacebar </strong>(or tap your finger on mobile devices). </p>

<p>4. To acquire more land, create a trail by moving away from your territory. Be sure to connect it back to your original plot of land when you’re ready.</p>

<h3 id="docs-internal-guid-ece47675-7fff-77de-6781-abf035e2c00d">
<span style="color: #434343;">While creating your trail, be careful not to run into your own trail or have someone run into your trail.

<p><strong>Q: Why is Discord adding games into voice channels?</strong></p>
<p>A: We started Discord because we are all about bringing people together around gaming. As Discord has grown, we've seen more and more people use our platform to come together around games. For instance, we’ve seen people use Discord to not only play <em>League</em> but also to hang out and play more casual, social games with friends like <em>Jackbox</em> and <em>Among Us</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Is there an age requirement?</strong></p>
<p>A: There is no age requirement for Land-io. By playing Land-io you confirm that you’re at least 13 years old and meet the minimum age of digital consent in your country, as required by our<a href="https://discord.com/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Terms of Service</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Q: What is a Public or Private game of Land-io?</strong></p>
<p>A: Public game may include players from outside of your servers. By default your username and avatar will be anonymized, assigning a character image and name to display in game. </p>
<p>Switching to a Private game will only include the players from inside the same Server and voice call that you are playing in.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can you use voice and video with players in a public game of Land-io?</strong></p>
<p>A: You can only use voice, video, or text chat with those inside your same server and voice call, regardless of being in a public or private game of Land-io.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How does player anonymization work in Land-io?</strong></p>
<p>A: Turning on anonymization in Public game mode assigns a character image and name to display in game instead of your username and avatar.</p>
<p>You can choose to turn off anonymization to show username and avatar to all players in the game (including those outside your server that are in the game.)</p>
<p><strong>Q: How do I play?</strong></p>
<p>A: To start a game, first join one of the voice channels. Once there, you should see the Activity Launcher (it looks like a rocket ship) in the voice channel controls. Click the Activity Launcher to open the Activity Shelf, " and then select "Land-io"</p>
