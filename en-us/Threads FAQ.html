<p>Discord can feel like an ocean sometimes with walls of text rapidly flooding your screen. Interesting conversations can be confusing to follow in the middle of other conversations and may just disappear entirely.</p>
<p>With <strong>Threads</strong>, you can belong to any conversation important to you and follow at your own pace.</p>
<h1 id="h_01JC631MX08T239AT42HDRG2RJ">What Are Threads?</h1>
<p>Threads allow multiple topics in a channel to exist and grow with their own dedicated space temporarily without having to commit to a new channel for the server. They make it easier to follow along with an unexpected topic that gains popularity and eliminates confusion when multiple, big topics are happening within a single channel.</p>
<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Note for Bot Developers:</strong> Are you looking to update your bots to receive gateway events for threads or things that happen in threads? Check out our Developer Documentation <a href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/threads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</div>
<h1 id="h_01JC631MX05PKVEQ85VG5KN4AE">Server Permissions for Threads</h1>
<p>In order to use threads, you will need to use four permissions that help you fine-tune which members can create threads and in which channels Threads can be made.</p>
<p>These permissions include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Send Messages in Threads</strong>
<ul>
<li>Allows server members to participate within threads only - not for all general channels in the server</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Create Public Threads</strong>
<ul>
<li>Allow server members to create threads that can be publicly viewed by others who have access to the text channel</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Create Private Threads</strong>
<ul>
<li>Allow server members to create private threads that can only be accessed by those who are mentioned in the thread</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Manage Threads</strong>
<ul>
<li>Allows members to rename, delete, close/open, lock, and turn on slow mode for threads. They can also view private threads.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="h_01JC631MX095RYNJ801CXCQGQ9">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<p><strong>Q: How do thread notification settings work?</strong></p>
<p>A: You can change your notification setting on a thread and set it to all messages/mentions only / no messages.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How do you search threads?</strong></p>
<p>A: Searching in a channel will include results from all threads in that channel</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I access and use Threads on mobile?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, Threads are available to everyone on both iOS and Android.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How many server members/roles can be within a thread?</strong></p>
<p>A: When mentioning a small role in a message in a thread, all of the members of that small role that are able to view the thread will be added to it and notified.</p>
<p>These roles must have less than 100 members each, and only 10 roles can be mentioned per message.</p>
<p>Threads also only allow 1,000 members to be added to them. So if the mentioned role would not fit in the thread, the role members will not be added.</p>
