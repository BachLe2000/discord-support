<h1 id="h_01JQPFH6B00NHG0K8P0FJQCTY7">Verification Levels</h1>
<p>Verification Levels refer to the levels of security a user must meet before they're <strong>allowed to send text messages in a channel</strong>. This is particularly useful in preventing bots and spam accounts from mass-joining your server, especially if you've made it public or have a never-expiring Instant Invite hanging around the web somewhere. Let's explore the five different levels of verification and understand how each one works.</p>
<div class="info-box">
<strong>NOTE</strong>: Having a verified phone number supersedes all other requirements. This means that if a user has a verified phone number on their Discord account, they can participate in servers with any verification level, without needing to meet the email verification or time-based requirements.</div>
<h2 id="h_01JQPFH6B0T584EH4S77QR39WZ">None</h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/31053169678743" width="624" height="61"></p>
<h4 id="h_01JQPFSMW32MAXQBTSR3917FK8" class="wysiwyg-text-align-center">Verification Level: None</h4>
<p>Selecting <strong>None</strong> will forego any verification security, and anyone who enters your server will be able to chat immediately upon entering. Better suited for private servers amongst your buddies.</p>
<h2 id="h_01JQPFH6B094HZPMKDH1A0P66F">Low</h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/31053169680151" width="624" height="61"></p>
<h4 id="h_01JQPFVCV468YAQ65E66A8BHJ4" class="wysiwyg-text-align-center">Verification Level: Low</h4>
<p>If you've set your server verification settings to <strong>Low</strong>, the user must have a <strong>verified email</strong> on their Discord account before they're approved to participate in the server. Steps for verifying your email can be found in this <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/213219267-Resending-Verification-Email"><span class="wysiwyg-underline" style="color: #1155cc;">article</span></a>.</p>
<h2 id="h_01JQPFH6B0S77CDA24TFBVY3DR">Medium</h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/31053169681687" width="624" height="61"></p>
<h4 id="h_01JQPFVMDKS08WXZ35TTSG3D4F" class="wysiwyg-text-align-center">Verification Level: Medium</h4>
<p><strong>Medium</strong> server verification settings will require your Discord account to have a <strong>verified email</strong>. It must be <strong>verified for longer than five minutes</strong> before you are able to start chatting in the server.</p>
<h2 id="h_01JQPFH6B0A8QXK4A8G4QEQV7J">High</h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/31053162338455" width="624" height="61"></p>
<h4 id="h_01JQPFVTX40CZ9B1MSA8CXGA03" class="wysiwyg-text-align-center">Verification Level: High</h4>
<p><strong>High</strong> is the next step security setting you can lockdown your server with. Including requiring a <strong>verified email</strong> AND being <strong>registered on Discord for more than 5 minutes</strong>. You must also be present in the server for longer than 10 minutes.</p>
<h2 id="h_01JQPFH6B0VX79AAQH05NGWBXJ">Highest</h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/31053162342295" width="624" height="61"></p>
<h4 id="h_01JQPFW1CGEB6SKANPA2G8B7H5" class="wysiwyg-text-align-center">Verification Level: Highest</h4>
<p><strong>Highest</strong> is the maximum level of security you can add to your server. In addition to everything above (<strong>verified email, registered user for 5+ minutes, and server member for 10+ minutes</strong>), they will also need to have a <strong>verified phone number</strong> attached to their Discord account.</p>
<div class="info-box">If you’re running into issues while verifying your account for a server, please reach out to the server’s admin for further assistance.</div>

<h1 id="h_01JQPFH6B1YG0QWRNRKB1C4TKG">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<p><strong>Q: What happens if a user doesn't meet the verification requirements?</strong></p>
<p>A: Users who don't meet the verification requirements won't be able to send text messages in the server channels or join voice channels. They'll need to complete the required verification steps based on the server's settings before they can participate.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Do I still need to meet other requirements if I have a verified phone number?</strong></p>
<p>A: No. Having a verified phone number supersedes all other requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can different channels have different verification levels?</strong></p>
<p>A: No, verification levels are set server-wide and apply to all channels within that server. However, you can use channel-specific permissions for additional control over who can access and interact in specific channels.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can server administrators bypass verification requirements?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, server administrators and moderators with appropriate permissions can send messages regardless of the verification level settings.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What should I do if I'm having trouble meeting verification requirements?</strong></p>
