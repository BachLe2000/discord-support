<a id="_yvsj9qgn933m"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h1><p><strong>Q: Will my messages be read by an app if I add it to a DM/direct message or group message? What information about me will apps have access to? </strong></p><p>A: Your messages will not be read by an app if you decide to add it to a direct message or group message. When you interact with an app in a DM or group message, along with the interaction information (e.g., your command to the app), the app can also access your basic profile information (e.g., username, user ID, avatar, banner, and public flags like the badges you have) and selected language. As a reminder, these apps have been developed by third parties so before you choose to use an app, you should review any terms and policies provided by the developer as they apply to your use.</p><p><strong>Q: How can you remove an app from a DM or group message?</strong></p><p>A: There are two ways to remove an app. First, you can right-click on an App in the DM or group message and tap on <strong>Remove App</strong> to remove the app at any time. </p><p>Second, you can tap directly on the profile of the app and then click on <strong>Remove App</strong>. A notification will appear in the DM or group message stating the app was removed.</p><p><br></p><p><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/16041494090135"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/16041491733911"></p><p><strong>Q: What can I do if the app isn’t working or I’m having issues with it?</strong></p><p>A: The developer of the app (not Discord) is responsible for the app. If you experience issues with an app, please contact the developer (e.g., through a support server they maintain). If you experience issues with Discord, visit our <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us">Help Center</a> for more information.</p>
