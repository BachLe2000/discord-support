<h3 id="h_01HQTZPMFPDSX64H8B9GEZ33W3"><span style="color: #434343;">If Sharing mode is not enabled, participants will only be able to delete the videos they have added to the playlist. The host is the only person who can delete any video in Hosting mode. </span></h3>
<h2 id="docs-internal-guid-f820490b-7fff-6445-69b3-fa9be8bea404">Hosting or Sharing</h2>
<p>By default, the person who started Watch Together is the host. In <strong>Hosting mode</strong>, the host controls what’s playing, pausing, scrubbing, skipping, reordering, and can delete any video from the playlist. However, anyone can add videos to the playlist. </p>
<p>If the host wants others to be able to control the video playback, they can toggle to <strong>Sharing mode</strong>. When sharing, all participants have control over the playlist, the video, and their actions to the video state apply to every user in the session. </p>
<h3 id="docs-internal-guid-7a251d43-7fff-a024-6d1a-158ce11320e7"><span style="color: #434343;">We recommend Hosting when in big groups and Sharing when in small groups!</span></h3>

<p>When using Watch Together on desktop, you can adjust the video volume within the video itself using the volume slider in the video or by adjusting your device’s volume. </p>

<h1 id="docs-internal-guid-9c358c94-7fff-9b3f-b939-4eaf8c4d46e2">FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h1>
<p><strong>Q: If I pause the video, does it pause for everyone else?</strong></p>
<p>A: <span style="color: #444746;">Yes, if one user pauses the video, it will pause for everyone. However, when the remote is not shared </span>only the Host can pause the video. </p>
<p><strong>Q: How does saved search history work?</strong></p>
<p>A: Your search history is saved locally and is only visible to you, so the next time you use Watch Together you can easily select from things you have searched for before. Search history is only used to provide possible searches, it is not used to customize search results or recommended videos.  </p>
<p>You can clear the history by clicking “Remove” next to each item in the search history list.</p>
<p><strong>Q: </strong><strong><span style="color: #444746;">Why does Watch Together stop playing videos?</span></strong></p>
<p>A: Playback of videos is limited to 180 minutes if watching with a group or 30 minutes if watching alone. When the max playback limit is reached by an individual user, playback will end for that user. This will start a 10-minute cool-down, after which you can continue watching. This same timer applies no matter what server or voice chat you are in. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the video will continue playing for viewers who have not reached their playback limit. </p>
<p>If you are Hosting and hit your playback limit, Watch Together will automatically assign Host to someone who has not reached their playback limit.You do not reclaim Host status when your cooldown timer runs out.</p>
<p>If you do not interact with Watch Together for 30 minutes, your session will be paused until you interact with WT again. If you are Host and you hit your inactivity limit, Watch Together will not reassign host to another user. </p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I hide the Activity Launcher or remove the activity from my server?</strong></p>
<p>A: If you have the admin permission in your server, you can hide the Activity Launcher for certain roles. To do this, go to Server Settings &gt; Roles &gt; Permissions &gt; Voice Channel Permissions and toggle off the "Use Activities" permission.</p>
<p>You can also hide the Activity Launcher for a channel category or specific voice channel by right-clicking and going to Voice Channel Permissions.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I change this activity to my preferred language?</strong></p>
<p>A: This Activity is currently available only in English, but you can search for videos in different languages within the YouTube player.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why can’t I hear the video’s audio?</strong></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">A: Watch Together plays audio through your operating system's audio output device. Your operating system's audio output could be different from your Discord audio output. If you are hearing the voices of other people in a call, but you're not hearing the audio from videos in Watch Together, it means you have set your Discord audio output to a different device than your system audio output.</span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><br></span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">To change the audio output for Watch Together, you'll need to change the audio source selected for your operating system. To find and update your operating system's audio output, look for the speakers icon in the Taskbar on Windows, or in System Preferences on a Mac.</span></p>
<p><strong>Q: I have YouTube Premium. Why do I see ads while in Watch Together? </strong></p>
<p>A: Watch Together utilizes YouTube's embedded player and does not support logging into your YouTube account during Activity sessions. Any restrictions will still apply when launching the activity.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #2e3338;">Q: Where can I report bugs and problems with the activity?</span></strong></p>
