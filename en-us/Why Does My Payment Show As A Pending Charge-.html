<p>If you see a pending charge on Discord, this indicates that the charge was unsuccessful because it requires further verification from your bank or card provider. You’ll need to reach out to your payment provider for steps on how to correct this pending charge. </p>
<p>If the pending charge isn't resolved, it will automatically cancel within 3 days. The status of the charge will then change to Failed in your <strong>User Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Billing</strong>. If a pending charge still appears on your bank statement, it should be removed within 5-10 business days.</p>
<h1 id="h_01JF80DSSJSTWDTT06BWW86HBT">What if I see Multiple Pending Charges?</h1>
<p>The only time you may see multiple pending charges are when your payments have not been successfully processed, or they’re in a Past Due state. </p>
<p>When renewing a subscription and your renewal payment does not successfully go through, we will attempt the purchase again to ensure that your subscription goes uninterrupted. Once a payment successfully goes through, our system will attempt to cancel all other pending payments. </p>

<strong>Note:</strong> If you are still seeing the pending charge after 10 business days, you can reach out to the Billing Support team for them to review through here: <a href="http://dis.gd/billing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dis.gd/billing</a>
