<h2 id="h_01FBJJ5MXD8WM3EKKKEGBQHHGE">Payment Info and Subscription Questions</h2>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-color-blue80 wysiwyg-font-size-large">Q: Why do I need to submit my payment info to redeem Nitro?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Because Nitro is a subscription plan, at the end of your free 1 month trial, we will start your first billing cycle so you can continue to enjoy Nitro on Discord.</p>
<p>However, you can cancel the Nitro subscription at any time before the end of the three months.</p>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-color-blue80 wysiwyg-font-size-large">Q: Why do I see a temporary hold/charge on my account when this is supposed to be a free promotion?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Just to clarify, this Nitro promotion is free, however, there will be a <strong>temporary hold</strong> placed on the payment method upon activating the promotion. This is to help Discord confirm the payment method works as expected and to prevent the use of fraudulent payment methods. This charge will appear in your Discord transaction history, and it may appear as a hold on your payment method.</p>
<p>We immediately reverse the temporary hold, and you’ll see that reflected in your Discord transaction history. Your bank may take longer to remove the hold from your payment method.</p>
<h3>
<strong>Note:</strong> Banks will usually remove the temporary hold from your account within a few business days.</h3>
<p>If your Discord transaction history does not show the hold released after 5 business days, please let us know at <a href="https://dis.gd/contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://dis.gd/contact</a>, and our support team will be able to investigate this issue further.</p>
<h2 id="h_01FCZMZX80MVAKFFS5AM4SYJC2">Potential Errors and Other Issues</h2>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-color-blue80 wysiwyg-font-size-large">Q: I see a Sad Trombone error when I try to redeem my Nitro promo link.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would you happen to be entering this Nitro promo link from the Tower of Fantasy promotion into the Discord Gift Inventory or as a link within Discord chat? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If so, this is the incorrect method for redeeming the Nitro promo link, and you will see an error when attempting to redeem the promotion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to successfully claim this promotion, try opening up an incognito browser and then copy and pasting the promotion link into your browser's address bar (also known as a location bar or URL bar). </span></p>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-color-blue80 wysiwyg-font-size-large">Q: I see a "<span class="wysiwyg-underline">Oh no! It looks like you have Nitro already</span>" error when I try to redeem my Nitro promo link.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> If you're seeing an "Oh no! It looks like you have Nitro already" error, that means that the Discord account you're trying to redeem this promotion on currently has a Nitro subscription so it is ineligible for this Nitro promotion.</p>
<p>Please make sure you're logged into the account that you want to redeem this promotion on. Or you can give the promotion link to a friend who hasn't had Nitro before.</p>

<p><strong>A: </strong>If you're seeing an “Sorry, looks like you’ve already had a Nitro sub” error, that means that you've previously subscribed to Nitro on your Discord account and you won't be able to redeem this 1 month perk. However, this promo link can be gifted to a friend.</p>
<p>If you have never subscribed to Nitro, please submit a ticket through our support system: <a href="https://dis.gd/contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://dis.gd/contact</a> and our support team will be able to investigate further.</p>

<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-color-blue80 wysiwyg-font-size-large">Q: I see a "<span class="wysiwyg-underline">This gift has already been redeemed</span>" error when I try to redeem my Nitro promo link.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> If you are seeing a "This gift has been redeemed already" error, that means that the Nitro promo link has already been used and cannot be used again. You may need to double check if you've redeemed this promo link on another Discord account.</p>
<p>In particular, if you redeemed this promo link using your mobile device, double check the browser on your mobile device and see which Discord account you are currently logged into.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, once the promo link has been redeemed, the promo link cannot be re-enabled, and the Nitro cannot be transferred from one account to another.</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you're seeing an “Wait a Second...Looks like this code didn't work.” error, that means that the link is invalid. If you've copy and pasted this link, we recommend you double check the link you were given once more and make sure it exactly matches the link sent to your email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you received this link from a friend, double check with your friend on the exact link to make sure that it matches the link in their email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please note that our support team is unable to intervene if your friend has given an invalid link and we will not be able to provide a new link.</span></p>
