<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you participate in the Sneaker Sweepstakes (“</span><strong>Event</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">”), we, Discord Inc., 444 De Haro Street, Suite 200, San Francisco, CA 94107, collect the personal information that you submit with your entry into the Event. This personal information may include your user name, name, Discord ID. We use it for the purposes of administering the Event in accordance with its Official Rules, and exercising or discharging Discord’s rights and obligations under applicable law. Your submission will be visible to all users of the service to which you posted your submission. We disclose personal information to our service providers in the U.S. and the EU  who process it only on our behalf and subject to confidentiality agreements and other appropriate data protection measures.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are laws in the jurisdictions where we are running this Event that require us to disclose the personal information of Event entrants and winners to government entities so that they can ensure that we are running this Event fairly and in compliance with applicable consumer protection, marketing and other laws. If a government entity requests these details, we will provide them to the government entity. Under the GDPR, the lawful basis for this disclosure is to advance our legitimate interests in running an Event that complies with applicable laws.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certain U.S. and British laws require us to publish or disclose the names (and in some cases countries) of winners to third parties that request this information from us. These laws are intended to ensure that we run the Event fairly and in compliance with applicable laws. If you are selected as a potential winner of the Event, a condition of claiming a prize and becoming a winner of the Event is that we may disclose your name and country for this purpose. This is a necessary part of our contract with you when you accept a prize to win the Event because our contract requires us to comply with the laws that apply to us and applicable laws require us to make these disclosures. Under the GDPR, the lawful basis for this disclosure is to perform our contract with you to run the Event in accordance with applicable laws, or else to advance our legitimate interests in running an Event that complies with applicable laws. Discord retains personal information submitted during the Event for as long as necessary to administer the Event and comply with applicable laws.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you post a submission as part of the Event, Discord may separately request your consent to retain and use your personal information or other information in your submission for promotional purposes. </span><strong>You are not required to provide such consent to enter or win the Event and providing your consent will not increase your chances of winning.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Participation in the Event is voluntary but we require some personal information from you to enter you into the Event, and you cannot win a prize unless we may disclose your name and country to third parties where required by applicable laws. </span></p>
