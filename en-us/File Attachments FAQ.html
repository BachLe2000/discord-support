<p>In addition to text messages, users can upload file attachments in Discord to send to others. If you have Nitro, you can upload <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000435108"><span class="wysiwyg-underline" style="color: #1155cc;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">even bigger files</span></a>. For non-Nitro subscribers, the maximum file upload is 25MB. </p>
<p>There is a wide variety of file types that can be uploaded to Discord. Here are the most common examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>JPEG</li>
<li>PDF</li>
<li>MOV</li>
<li>MP4</li>
<li>MP3</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="h_01J4M00QYZTXY5FV9KDWT05H5T">How to Attach Files</h1>
<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Note: </strong>If you upload multiple video files, images, or GIFs in one message, they will be sent together and displayed as a mosaic format.</div>
<p>1. Tap on the <strong>plus sign</strong> [<img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/25444321144727" width="26" height="26">] located in the text field of the text channel, text chat of a voice channel, or group message that you want to send a file attachment in and then tap on <strong>Upload a File</strong>.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/25444343254807" width="303" height="317"></p>
<p>2. Select the file(s) that you want to attach from your device. You can also write a message to send along with it. </p>
<p>3. Your file(s) and any text that you included will be sent together in one message.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/25444321148695" width="318" height="391"></p>
<p>If you attach non-image files, such as a PDF, DOC, etc.  the files will display as embeds in your message and will not provide a preview of the attached file.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color=""><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/25444343260567" width="624" height="223"></span></p>
<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Note: </strong>If you want to include Spoiler Tags before sending a file to someone, you can learn how to do that in this <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022320632-Spoiler-Tags" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Help Center article</a>.</div>
<h1 id="h_01J4M00QYZ1NVBTHE6E6A3BSXR">File Upload Settings</h1>
<p>There are some settings you can enable to prevent or even minimize the attachments you'll see in Discord.</p>
<h2 id="h_01J4M00QYZG2NM4G307YCRNS5B">Desktop/Browser</h2>
<p>1. Tap on the <strong>cogwheel </strong>[<img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/25444343262359" width="23" height="24">] in the bottom-left corner of the app.</p>
<p>2. Navigate to the <strong>Chat </strong>tab. </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/25444321155351" width="624" height="461"></p>
<p>3. A setting is enabled if there’s a checkmark or a setting is disabled if there’s an <strong>x</strong>.</p>
<p>Here is how each setting works:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>When posted as links to chat: </strong>When an image is posted as a link, the image will be displayed instead of the text link.</li>
<li>
<strong>When uploaded directly to Discord: </strong>Any image that is larger than 10MB will be shared as a download instead.</li>
<li>
<strong>With image descriptions: </strong>Used for screen readers to describe any shared image.</li>
<li>
<strong>Show embeds and preview website links pasted into the chat: </strong>Embeds and website links will display a preview, unless disabled.</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/25444321156119" width="624" height="395"></p>
<h2 id="h_01J4M00QYZT1EQE0XSJJ326S6Q">Mobile</h2>
<p>1. Tap on your profile image in the bottom-right corner.</p>
<p>2. Press on the <strong>cogwheel </strong>[<img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/25444343262359" width="23" height="24">] in the top-right corner.</p>
<p>3. Navigate to the <strong>Chat </strong>tab. </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/25444343269143" width="405" height="810"></p>
<p>4. On this page, you can enable or disable any setting. If enabled, you’ll see a checkmark. If disabled, you’ll see an <strong>x</strong>.</p>
<p>5. A lot of the settings on Desktop/Browser are the same for mobile, but let’s go over the mobile-only settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Save to Device: </strong>If you directly send an image or video through your mobile device, the file will be automatically saved to your phone.</li>
<li>
<strong>Video Uploads: </strong>In this section, you can manage the quality of videos you upload through Discord. By selecting the "Data Saver" option, your videos will upload more quickly and consume less data.</li>
<li>
<strong>Data Saving Mode: </strong>If enabled, images and videos will be sent in lower quality through your cellular network to use less data.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="h_01J4M00QYZMNPF2W7MRC1QHWSZ">What is NSFW Content Scanning?</h1>
<p>"NSFW" or Not Safe For Work (or not suitable for work) is a term to describe inappropriate content that you wouldn't want to look at while in the workplace and is now more widely used to describe content that could be seen as inappropriate for the public.</p>
<p>To help keep users safe, we have both a user and server setting to scan images for NSFW content. If the setting is enabled and the system detects the image could be NSFW, it will block the upload.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color=""><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/25444321164695" width="624" height="52"></span><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color=""><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/25444321167255" width="624" height="68"></span></p>

<h1 id="h_01J4M00QYZM3445WFF5918B3R4">How to Use Alt Text</h1>
<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Note: </strong>ALT text can’t be added to an image if it has already been uploaded.</div>
<p>ALT text - short for alternative text - is a feature that allows users to write an image description to uploads so that anyone using a screen reader can obtain a description of the image without needing to see the actual image itself. </p>
<p>1. Once you attach the image(s) you want to upload, tap on the <strong>pencil</strong> icon [<img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/25444343277591" width="23" height="23">] that appears after hovering your cursor over each file.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/25444343280023" width="307" height="272"></p>
<p>2. You can change the name of the file and add in the ALT text to describe the image. Press on <strong>Save</strong> when you’re finished. </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/25444321174295" width="494" height="448"></p>
<p>3. You can now send your image(s) with the alt text you’ve written. </p>
<p>4. If you have the <strong>With image descriptions </strong>setting enabled and if an image has ALT text, you should see the word <strong>ALT</strong> on the image. Select <strong>ALT</strong> and you will then see the ALT text for the image.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/25444343283735" width="524" height="477"></p>
<p>If an image has ALT text, you'll be able to see it when you have <strong>With image descriptions</strong> enabled in your <strong>Text &amp; Images</strong> settings. If you need a visual aid, pressing <strong>ALT</strong> this will show the text.</p>
<p>Congratulations! You now have the skills to upload images, send files, and perform other actions through Discord.</p>
