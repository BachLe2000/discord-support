<p><strong>Q: Why am I unable to complete Quest while using Linux?</strong></p>
<p>A: Currently, Quest rewards are unable to be earned on Linux devices. </p>
<p>However, our team is looking into a resolution for this issue so that earning Quest rewards is possible on Linux in the future. For now, we recommend completing the requirement on a different operating system, like Windows. </p>

<p><strong>Q: I no longer see a Quest. Where did it go?</strong></p>
<p>A: Quests are typically only available for a limited amount of time. If you no longer see a Quest in the <strong>Quest</strong> <strong>Home</strong> (<strong>Discover &gt; Quests</strong>) or in-app notifications about the quest, the period to complete and claim the reward for the Quest is over.</p>
<p><strong>Q: When I press on “Claim Reward” I'm loading FOREVER, why is this?</strong></p>
<p>A: Fear not, you should still see the avatar decoration in your User Settings. Updating your Discord app can also resolve the issue if you're not seeing the reward.</p>
