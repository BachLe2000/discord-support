<p>Here are the steps to take if you do not recognize charges made on Discord:</p>
<h1 id="h_01J3RFBBRN9DBNXX8WW7JFHEXQ"><strong>I have a charge from Discord I don't recognize</strong></h1>
<p>Make sure the charge comes from Discord. All purchases made within Discord will be labeled <strong>DISCORD*ItemName</strong> within credit/debit card statements depending on how your bank renders this and PAYPAL DISCORD if completed through PayPal.</p>
<p><strong>Please double check these common issues first:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The charge is from a family member or friend</li>
<li><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360030834111" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pending charges</a></li>
<li>The charge is associated with an alternate Discord account</li>
<li>The charge came from a renewal or a trial</li>
</ul>
<div class="form-box">If you still do not recognize the charge(s), please contact our billing team by creating a ticket <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000118612" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and select <strong>Unauthorized Transaction.</strong>
</div>
<div class="warn-box">We strongly encourage you to let our billing team investigate prior to disputing, as we may be unable to refund charges if a dispute has already been initiated.</div>
