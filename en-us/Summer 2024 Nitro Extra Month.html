<p><strong>Q: I don't see the promotion details on my Nitro tab. Why?</strong></p>
<p>A: If you don't see any promotion details on your Nitro tab on the desktop or browser (this promotion is not available on the mobile apps), it is because you do not meet the eligibility criteria.</p>

<p>A: Yes, this promotion applies for upgrades from Nitro Basic or Classic to Nitro.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> <strong>How much will I be charged if I upgrade my plan to Nitro?</strong></p>
<p>A: We prorate the amount you'll be charged for upgrading to Nitro, which depends on:<br>1. Whether you're upgrading from Basic or Classic<br>2. The amount of your existing subscription plan you haven’t used<br>3. The remaining amount of your new subscription plan you will use after upgrading<br>For example, if you've used Nitro Basic for only 10 days this month, you'll only be charged for those 10 days at Basic's price. Then, if you upgrade to Nitro mid-month and have 20 days left, you'll only pay for those 20 days at Nitro's price, rather than for the entire month.
