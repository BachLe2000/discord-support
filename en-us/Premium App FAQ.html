<h1 id="h_01HW8TY8QFJCECCV7WNMYRBKVS">What are Premium App Features</h1>
<p>Apps can offer certain premium features that users can purchase on Discord to get enhanced functionality (such as more commands) for the app. </p>
<p>Developers of the apps provide the premium features and any associated content. They are responsible for creating the offerings and their descriptions, and providing the purchased features to users. Please read the descriptions carefully to make sure you understand what exactly you are buying.</p>
<h1 id="h_01HW8TY8QFDBMEY2D4KYJ4H9GB">What Are Premium App Subscriptions</h1>
<p><span style="color: #2e3338;">Premium App Subscriptions are a monthly subscription to premium features of an app that any individual member or server admin in a server can purchase to get enhanced functionality and more commands for the app. Any Discord user can purchase a user subscription for an app and personally utilize it in any server the user and app are both part of, while a server admin can purchase a guild subscription for an app that can be used by server members across the entire server. At the discretion of the developer of the app, subscriptions can be divided up into tiers and each tier may have unique pricing and features.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #2e3338;">As a reminder, developers of the apps provide the premium subscriptions and features and are responsible for them. Please read the tier descriptions carefully to make sure you understand what exactly you are buying.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #2e3338;">Because these are a recurring subscription, we’ll charge you monthly until you cancel the subscription (which you can do any time as further described below). A subscription may also be removed if the subscription is no longer available for purchase.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #2e3338;">If you are unhappy with your Premium App Subscription, try contacting the developer of the app directly. If that doesn’t resolve your issue, you can request a refund </span><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/9359445233303#h_01GFK3DZ3PGJ0DKGE61VEK5J51" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as described below</a><span style="color: #2e3338;">. If you experience technical issues with Discord that prevent you from accessing your Premium App Subscription, reach out to us at </span><a href="https://dis.gd/billing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dis.gd/billing</a><span style="color: #2e3338;"> and choose “Premium Apps” under Type of billing issue. If you experience technical issues with an app, please contact the developer of the app.</span></p>
<h1 id="h_01HW8TY8QFRCVZFFXM55XWV0NT">What are Premium App One-Time Purchases</h1>
<h3 id="h_01HW8TY8QF93W8JEPDQNK3K2ZF"><span style="color: #434343;">One-time purchases are non-refundable. </span></h3>
<p>Besides monthly subscriptions, you can also make a one-time purchase as offered by a developer for their app! Unlike subscription-based purchases, a one-time purchase does not repeat or renew. Once the transaction is completed, there are no further charges related to the purchase unless an additional purchase is made.</p>
<p>As a reminder, developers of the apps are responsible for providing these purchased features. Please read the descriptions carefully to make sure you understand exactly what you’re buying, including any applicable access limitations or expiration. If you are dissatisfied with your one-time Premium App purchase, reach out directly to the app's developer.</p>
<h1 id="h_01HW8TY8QFQSKQ5ZWVVHRPTGTQ">How To Purchase A Premium App Subscription or One-Time Purchase</h1>
