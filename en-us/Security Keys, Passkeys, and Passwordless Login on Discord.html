<p>Discord supports the newest standards for authentication: Passkeys and Security Keys, an easier to use <em>and</em> more secure way to sign into your account! Passkeys are encrypted digital keys you create using your fingerprint, face, or screen lock, and they can be stored in a password manager. When you log into Discord, your device will prompt you to identify yourself using a Passkey/Security Key (e.g., with Face ID), and then you’re logged in! No password needed.</p>
<p>All you’ll need to do is <strong>Register a Passkey</strong>. Once you’ve done that, you’re set! The next time you sign in, you’ll be able to use that passkey for one-step login -<a href="https://www.notion.so/Security-Keys-Passkeys-and-Passwordless-Login-on-Discord-85efa0b891b344568a19db6de47ccfed?pvs=21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> see below for more details</a>.</p>

<p>6. And you’re done! Make sure to download and store your backup codes.</p>
<h2 id="h_01J806DMWB8WRKBS04YXX47CJQ">Desktop/Browser</h2>
<p>1. Start by selecting the the cogwheel [<img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/26429353477399" width="23" height="24">] next to your username.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>5. After enrolling MFA, the Discord app will also have a list of backup codes for login: each of these can be used once instead of a code generated by your app, in case you lose access to it. Make sure to <strong>download and store these backup codes!</strong> If you lose these, Discord can’t help you get back into your account.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/26429365139351" width="609" height="422"></p>
<p>And you’re done!</p>
<p>You can now register another Security Key on this device or a different device (you can have up to 16 security keys/passkeys at the same time).</p>
<h1 id="h_01J806DMWBQWMCM3XC01X2PX61">Passwordless Login with Passkeys</h1>
<p>Using your passkey to log in is simple! As long as you have a password manager available with a passkey saved in it, you will be prompted to select a passkey. If you’re not getting prompted, you can always tap on <strong>Or, sign in with Passkey</strong> instead. Your system will prompt you to select the Passkey associated with your account and complete a challenge (e.g., Face ID), then you’re logged in!</p>

<h1 id="h_01J806DMWB34KBHKM4XSWZ0FGM">How to Use Security Keys</h1>
<p>While Security Keys function similarly to passkeys, they generally cannot be used for one-step login on Discord. Fear not! You’ll still be able to use Security Keys as a form of MFA - when you log in, you’ll get an additional challenge after entering your username and password to use you security key:</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/26429365142807" width="624" height="363"></p>
<p>Press <strong>Authenticate with security key</strong> to interact with your Security Key, and you’re in!</p>
<h1 id="h_01J806DMWBCY8EPFTCYAP1KEF7">Passkey Troubleshooting</h1>
<p>Having issues with your passkey when trying to log in? Here are some troubleshooting steps to try if your passkey isn’t working for any reason:</p>
<p>First, try using your username and password to log in, then using your Passkey on the following MFA Challenge screen. If that doesn’t work, you’ll need to delete the existing Passkey from both your device and Discord account, then set it up once again. To do this:</p>
<p>1. Make sure you have your Discord backup codes handy just in case. Open your password manager and remove the passkey from your saved credentials for Discord. Refer to your password manager’s documentation for details on how to do this.</p>
<p>2. Use a different MFA method or device to complete the challenge. If you don’t have another set up, you can use a backup code from the list you saved to complete the MFA challenge and finish the login.</p>
<p>3. Go to your Account Settings and repeat the enrollment process to register a new passkey with your password manager. See<a href="#h_01J806DMWB4STCJ8RCKAEF3EV8"> How to Register Passkeys</a> above for more details, and be sure to remember what you name it!</p>
<p>4. From the Account Settings screen, delete the old passkey associated with your Discord account.</p>
<p>And now you’re starting fresh! Following these steps ensures your remaining saved backup codes continue to work while enrolling a new Passkey.</p>
