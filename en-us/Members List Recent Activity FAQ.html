<h1 id="h_01HRZ59A41YS32ZJVG8XK9W998">What is the Members List Recent Activity Feature?</h1>
<div class="exp-box">This feature is currently in beta. It is limited to a small percentage of users within English-prominent regions and available only on the desktop app. The experiment may be modified or discontinued.</div>
<p>Want to easily catch up with your friends and create more shared experiences together?</p>
<p>With the <strong>Members List Recent Activity </strong>feature, you’ll be able to view the recent activities of your friends and recent contacts - including the video games they’re playing, the music they’re listening to, and much more!</p>

<h2 id="h_01HRZ59A41FYWYQ04F9M5G6A1T">Viewing Activity Cards</h2>
<p>With the <strong>Members List Recent Activity</strong> feature, you’ll be able to view <strong>activity cards </strong>within Discord. <strong>Activity cards</strong> will show live and recent activities of those you’ve interacted with - within servers and your friends. </p>
<p>If an activity is currently taking place, it’ll show an incrementing timer for how much time has elapsed. Otherwise, it’ll show how long ago the activity took place. </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/22075711437079" width="255" height="461"></p>
<p>You can collapse the view down to three activity cards and expand to see everything (up to 50 recent activities).</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/22075711451799" width="364" height="80"></p>
<p id="docs-internal-guid-89d7b8ee-7fff-5a4f-8a4f-9745e0f2136f">You can also choose to fully collapse activity cards or hide activity cards by selecting the <strong>cogwheel </strong>[<img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/22244053468183" width="26" height="24">] (within the activity card) and pressing the checkbox for the <strong>Hide Activity Cards </strong>option. </p>

<h2 id="h_01HRZ59A41S2JJDPJXRQKRAPMA">Engaging with Activity Cards</h2>
<p>Want to ask a friend about that new game they’re playing? By selecting the activity cards, you can reply directly to the activity or even send them an emoji. In either case, this will send a direct message (<strong>DM</strong>) with a reference to the activity.</p>
<p> </p>

<h2 id="h_01HRZ59A41YF3GVZRBNZWXQVZK">Types of Activity Content</h2>
<p>Initially, the content shown within activity cards will reflect gaming activity, but over time, other types of activity will also be shown - including game achievements, Spotify, Crunchyroll, and more.</p>
<h2 id="h_01HRZ59A41W46PH064PDY7PWEZ">Activity Privacy</h2>
<p>You can prevent your activity from appearing in this feature in three ways: (1) globally, (2) for a specific server, or (3) for a specific game.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Globally</strong></span></p>
<p>If you want to control whether <strong><em>any</em></strong> detected game is shared, you can enable or disable your global settings in the <strong>Activity Privacy</strong> settings. </p>
<p>1. Head over to your <strong>User Settings </strong>by selecting the <strong>cogwheel </strong>[<span id="docs-internal-guid-0e88afa6-7fff-e857-cf35-8ca2474c00a2"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/22244053510039" width="26" height="24"></span>] in the bottom left corner.</p>
<p>2. Then under the <strong>Activity Settings</strong> section, select <strong>Activity Privacy</strong>. </p>
<p>3. From here, you can use the toggle to enable or disable <strong>Share Activity with Others</strong>.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/22075711534743" width="600" height="386"></p>
<div class="info-box">
<strong>Note</strong>: Connected Accounts such as Xbox, PlayStation, Spotify, or Crunchyroll have their own settings for activity sharing. To disable sharing these activities, you can adjust the settings in <strong>Connections</strong> <strong>&gt;</strong> toggle <strong>Display</strong> <strong>as</strong> <strong>your</strong> <strong>status</strong>.
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/25974404869015" width="624" height="399"></strong></span></p>
</div>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Specific Server<br></strong></span></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">If you only want to prevent your detected game activity from appearing in a specific server, you can adjust your server-specific <strong>Privacy</strong> <strong>Settings</strong>.  Select the dropdown menu [<img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/25974376237591" width="24" height="24">] next to the server's name, select Privacy Settings, and then toggle <strong>Activity</strong> <strong>Status</strong>.</p>

<div class="info-box">
<strong>Note</strong>: Anyone you’ve friended in this server can still see your activity.</div>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Specific Games</strong></span></p>
<p>Alternatively, if you just want to prevent a specific game from being shared, you can disable specific games through the <strong>Registered Games </strong>menu. </p>
<p>1. Head over to your <strong>User Settings </strong>by selecting the <strong>cogwheel </strong>[<span id="docs-internal-guid-0e88afa6-7fff-e857-cf35-8ca2474c00a2"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/22244084820375" width="26" height="24"></span>] in the bottom left corner.</p>
<p>2. Then under the <strong>Activity Settings </strong>section, select <strong>Registered Games</strong>.</p>
<p>3. From here, you can select the icon for <strong>Toggle Detection </strong>to prevent a game from showing up in the activity cards going forward.</p>

<h1 id="h_01J1R2F8J2HK83DGBXQXJY4WK8">Game Profile</h1>
<div class="info-box"><span style="color: #434343;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">This feature does not display on the browser or mobile app and is only available on the desktop app (Windows, Mac, and Linux).</span></div>
<p>If someone is playing a game and a game profile exists for this game, you can tap on the game icon within the app and be provided with additional information. Here is how to access this.</p>
<p>1. Tap on the profile of the user you want to view (this can be done through a server’s members list in a server, DM, group chat message, or your friend’s list) and tap on the icon of the game they’re playing.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/24578027168151" width="264" height="73"></p>
<p>2. If the game has a game profile, the game icon will not only be clickable, but a page within the app will open to display information about the game. </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/24578027173911" width="624" height="488"></p>
<p>3. On a game profile, you can find any available information about the game (eg. genre, game summary, social links, Discord server, publisher, available platforms like device type, consoles, etc.)</p>
<p>It will also include screenshots and promotional art of the game, recommendations for similar games, and usernames of friends who have played the same game.</p>
<div class="info-box"><span style="color: #434343;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">If a game does not have a game profile, it’s because not enough users have played the game to display any data. </span></div>
