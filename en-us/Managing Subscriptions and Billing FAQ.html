<h1 id="docs-internal-guid-5f0782a4-7fff-8843-f22f-66f97347c229"><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h1>
<p><strong>Q: My payments are failing, and/or I see pending transactions in my bank statement. What should I do?</strong></p>
<p>A: Visit our <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/23082866222871" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Help Center article</a> to learn more about how to handle failed payments. </p>
<p><strong>Q: I want to remove all my payment methods, but I can't. What's going on?</strong></p>
<p>A: Removing payment methods does not end a subscription for you. In order to remove all payment methods, you will need to cancel any remaining active subscriptions first. Visit our Help Center article <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/19580873036695-How-to-Cancel-your-Nitro-Server-Boosting-or-other-Discord-Subscriptions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> for how to cancel your subscriptions.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What does “proration” mean?</strong></p>
<p>A: Proration for a subscription means adjusting the cost based on how much of the subscription period you've used. Discord uses this to ensure you’re being charged the correct amount when adding subscriptions or removing subscriptions on your account, and in situations like when accepting a special offer or discount. </p>
<p><strong>Q: I have a Nitro Monthly subscription, but I just purchased a Nitro Yearly subscription. Can I get a refund? </strong></p>
<p>A: Your original Nitro Monthly subscription was used as proration credit toward your Nitro Yearly subscription upgrade. This means the amount you paid for Nitro Yearly was not the full amount as you paid the prorated charge. When the subscription renews, you will be charged the full price of the subscription. To check your receipt, check User Settings &gt; Billing. </p>
<p><strong>Q: What’s the difference between the default payment method and my subscription payment method? </strong></p>
<p>A: The default payment method determines which payment will show first when making new purchases on Discord. However, your subscription payment method is what’s used to pay for your recurring Nitro and Boost subscriptions. <br>You can set the same payment method for both by following the steps to update your <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017693772#docs-internal-guid-1731ba7c-7fff-87a1-c976-f62cc1cd2618">default payment method</a> and <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017693772#docs-internal-guid-1ae109ec-7fff-410f-aa54-931f058a395d">updating your subscription payment method</a>.   </p>
<p>Please note that the payment method used to pay for server and app subscriptions specifically will not show a Subscription tag within the Billing tab, and these subscriptions will charge from either the original payment method selected or the payment method set for the specific App subscription in the Premium App Subscriptions list.<strong><br></strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: What happens if I previously purchased a Server Boost subscription, and now I’m buying an additional Nitro Yearly subscription?</strong></p>
<p>A: If you have purchased any additional subscription with a different billing cycle, <strong>Discord will unify all of your subscription payment dates</strong>. This means that your subscription type may change from a <em>monthly</em> cycle to a <em>yearly</em> cycle if you have purchased additional subscriptions with a <em>yearly</em> cycle.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you purchase an application or server subscription, your Server Boost subscription cycle won't be affected.</p>
<p>For example, if you initially had a Server Boost Monthly subscription, purchasing an additional  Nitro Yearly subscription will convert the current Server Boost Monthly subscription to a Server Boost Yearly subscription in order to simplify all subscription charges to one payment date.</p>
<p><strong>Q: When making a purchase, I see something called “adjustments.” What is this?</strong></p>
<p>A: Adjustments can be added to a purchase for a few reasons when signing up for additional subscription purchases, such as:  </p>
<ul>
<li>If you're changing your billing plan from monthly to yearly</li>
<li>If your payment is being prorated</li>
<li>If you are getting a discount</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q: I’m receiving a “Billing address is invalid” error when making purchase. How do I fix this?</strong></p>
<p>A: If you see this error while attempting to make a purchase, this means that the billing address associated with the card you are trying to use does not match the address filed with your bank. Please check <strong>User Settings &gt; Billing &gt; Select the card &gt; Edit</strong> and update your billing address. </p>
<p><strong>Q: Why do I still have server boosts when I canceled my Nitro subscription? </strong></p>
<p>A: Server Boosts are a separate monthly subscription, and it's possible that you have one or more Server Boost subscriptions active. To manage the subscription, you would need to go to your <strong>User Settings &gt; Subscriptions</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Q: I have a new Discord account, can I transfer my Nitro subscription to another account? </strong><br>A: Unfortunately, Discord doesn't currently support transferring Nitro subscriptions between accounts. We understand this might be a bit inconvenient, and we appreciate your understanding.</p>
