<p>Discord is partnering with a limited number of game developers to enhance various social and communication features within their games. For players of these games, it means some aspects of their in-game experience (such as in-game voice or friends lists) will be powered by Discord.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Does that mean I need a Discord account to play the game?</strong></p>
<p>A: Players will not be required to connect a Discord account to play the game.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I talk to my friends on Discord while playing this game?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, in some games, players are able to chat with friends across Discord while they’re in-game, even if their friends aren’t playing in the same game.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will this integration affect my game performance?</strong></p>
<p>A: No. The integrations are designed to avoid impacting game performance.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Does this mean Discord can access all the messages I send in the game?</strong></p>
<p>A: No, Discord only has access to DMs and messages sent between friends and in Linked Channels. Messages are handled according to <a href="https://discord.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What can the game developer do with my data?</strong></p>
<p>A: Game developers get access to the data that you agree to share when you choose to connect your Discord account to the game, and this may vary depending on the game. You will see what information you are agreeing to share when you go through the account connection process (whether in the game or on Discord). Game developers can use messages as needed to power the communications experience between Discord and their game. For more details on how data collected by the game may be used, please review the game’s Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, or similar information.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Am I required to use the in-game features that enable me to send/receive Discord messages and view my Discord friends from within a game?</strong></p>
<p>A: No, the social features that enable you to send/receive Discord messages and view your Discord friends from within a game are optional. You choose whether or not you’d like to connect your Discord account to enable them.</p>
<p><strong>Q: If I'm messaging someone on Discord, how can I tell when they’re messaging me from within a game?</strong></p>
<p>A: When a user has sent a message from within a game, a controller icon will appear next to their name as a visual indicator.</p>
