<h2 id="h_01J1QBC9CKZ6T7PASVZP4W0BKP">Payment Info and Membership Questions</h2>
<p><strong>Q: Why do I need to submit my payment info to redeem Nitro?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Because Nitro is a membership plan, at the end of your 1 month trial, we will start your first billing cycle so you can continue to enjoy Nitro on Discord.</p>
<p>However, you can cancel the Nitro membership at any time before the end of the 1 month.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why do I see a temporary hold/charge on my account when this is supposed to be a trial promotion?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Just to clarify, this Nitro promotion is a trial, however, there will be a <strong>temporary hold</strong> placed on the payment method upon activating the promotion. This is to help Discord confirm the payment method works as expected and to prevent the use of fraudulent payment methods. This charge will appear in your Discord transaction history, and it may appear as a hold on your payment method.</p>
<p>We immediately reverse the temporary hold, and you’ll see that reflected in your Discord transaction history. Your bank may take longer to remove the hold from your payment method.</p>
<h3 id="h_01J1QBC9CK2WWF9ZVT6ASCV2PH"><strong>Note: Banks will usually remove the temporary hold from your account within a few business days.</strong></h3>
<p>If your Discord transaction history does not show the hold released after 5 business days, please let us know at<a href="https://dis.gd/contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> https://dis.gd/contact</a>, and our support team will be able to investigate this issue further.</p>
<h2 id="h_01J1QBC9CKRZ9H04MT209T8Z71">Potential Errors and Other Issues</h2>
<p><strong>Q: I see a "Oh no! It looks like you have Nitro already" error when I try to redeem my Nitro promo.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> If you're seeing an "Oh no! It looks like you have Nitro already" error, that means that the Discord account you're trying to redeem this promotion on currently has a Nitro membership so it is ineligible for this Nitro promotion.</p>
<p>Please make sure you're logged into the account that you want to redeem this promotion on.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I see a "Sorry, looks like you’ve already had a Nitro sub!" error when I try to redeem my Nitro promo.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>If you're seeing an “Sorry, looks like you’ve already had a Nitro sub” error, that means that you've previously subscribed to Nitro on your Discord account and you won't be able to redeem this 1 month perk.</p>
<p>If you have never subscribed to Nitro, please submit a ticket through our support system:<a href="https://dis.gd/contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> https://dis.gd/contact</a> and our support team will be able to investigate further.</p>
<p>Be sure to include your full Discord ID and email address tied to your Discord account</p>
<p><strong>Q: I see a "This gift has already been claimed" error when I try to claim my Nitro promo.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> If you are seeing a "This gift has been claimed already" error, that means that the Nitro promo has already been used and cannot be used again. You may need to double check if you've claimed this promo on another Discord account.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, once the promo has been claimed, the promo cannot be re-enabled, and the Nitro cannot be transferred from one account to another.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I see a "Wait a Second...Looks like this code didn't work." error when I try to redeem my Nitro promo.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> If you're seeing an “Wait a Second...Looks like this code didn't work.” error, that means that the promo is invalid.</p>
<p>Please note that our support team is unable to intervene if you are given an invalid promo and we will not be able to provide a new promo.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I see a “Looks like something went wrong” error.</strong></p>
<p>A: There are several reasons why you may be seeing this error:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are ineligible for this promotion</li>
<li>The promotion is invalid</li>
<li>The promotion has reached the maximum number of claims</li>
<li>The link is invalid</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that the Discord support team is not able to assist if you run into this error when attempting to redeem. See the list above for possible reasons why your account may be ineligible or otherwise unable to redeem this promotion.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I see a "Wait a Second...Looks like this code didn't work." error when I try to redeem my Nitro promo link.</strong></p>
<p>A: If you're seeing an “Wait a Second...Looks like this code didn't work.” error, that means that the link is invalid. If you've copy and pasted this link, we recommend you double check the link you were given once more and make sure it exactly matches the link in your SteelSeries account.</p>
<p>If you received this link from a friend, double check with your friend on the exact link to make sure that it matches the link in their SteelSeries account.</p>
<p>Please note that our support team is unable to intervene if your friend has given an invalid link and we will not be able to provide a new link.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I see a "Sorry, This Payment Source Cannot Be Used for Redemption" error when trying to redeem my promo!</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> If you're seeing a "Sorry, This Payment Source Cannot Be Used for Redemption" error, that means that the payment method you've selected to cover the temporary $1 hold cannot be used for that purpose. </p>
<p>Please keep in mind that prepaid payment methods, such as Gcash, cannot be used to cover temporary holds due to the nature of how prepaid payment methods function.</p>
<p>For more information on temporary holds, please check out<a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4402712000663" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> this article</a>!</p>
<p><strong>Q: I see a “Looks like this promotion has reached its maximum number of claims” error when trying to redeem my promo!</strong></p>
<p>A: If you are seeing a “Looks like this promotion has reached its maximum number of claims” error, that means the maximum limit for claims of this promotion has been reached and this promotion can no longer be claimed. If you have claimed this Nitro promotion, you are still able to redeem it to your Discord account!</p>
<p>Please note that the support team is unable to assist you if you run into this error and we are not able to increase the limit of claims.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I see a “Looks like your email isn’t verified. Make sure to verify your email before claiming this gift.”</strong></p>
<p>A: If you are seeing a “Looks like your email isn’t verified, make sure to verify your email before claiming this gift” error, you are trying to redeem this Nitro promotion on a Discord account with an email that hasn’t been verified yet.</p>
<p>You can check out <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/213219267" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this support article</a> on how to resend the email verification for your Discord account.
