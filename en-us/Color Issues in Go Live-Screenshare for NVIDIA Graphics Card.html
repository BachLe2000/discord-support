<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-e8e0ddc1-7fff-0d88-27b5-1c91b405cf72">On October 20, 2023, we investigated a stream discoloration issue that occurred during screensharing in Discord for Windows users with the latest NVIDIA GPU driver, version 545.84. The outgoing stream can exhibit a loss in color values, creating a wash out image as you see below. This is a possible video encoder regression in NVIDIA’s 545.84 driver.</span></p>

<p>If you are impacted by this issue, <strong>we recommend upgrading to NVIDIA driver version 546.31 or later as that should resolve the discoloration in your Go Live stream</strong>.</p>
<p>You can download 546.31 using the following link: <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5507">https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5507</a> <br>To check if a newer driver exists for your system, you can search here: <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/download/find.aspx">https://www.nvidia.com/download/find.aspx</a></p>
