New usernames are lowercase, alphanumeric, limited to certain special characters, and </span><strong><span style="color: #434343;">do not have discriminators.</span></strong><span style="color: #434343;"> During the transition from old usernames to new usernames, some users will still have old usernames with discriminators (#0000) while other users will have new usernames.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To ensure Discord’s prompt compliance with the legal process, the user information provided needs to uniquely identify a Discord account. We can locate users in our system by user identification number, username, and email. The user identification number is the most preferred. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Failure to include requisite information will result in Discord’s inability to comply with the legal process. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">IP addresses, usernames (without the discriminator), and server nicknames can be helpful to support any of the above, however, they are insufficient to uniquely identify an account as they can be shared by multiple Discord accounts. </span></p>
