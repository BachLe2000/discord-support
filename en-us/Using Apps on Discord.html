These apps can range from bots that automate tasks, to activities that allow you to play games, collaborate on projects, or share experiences with others directly within Discord. </p>
<p id="docs-internal-guid-1535fe26-7fff-4baf-b0cb-a3bdffa72cf6"><span id="docs-internal-guid-834c5bb4-7fff-e016-2397-85f028024bb3">Apps can be created by members of our developer community and made available on Discord as third-party services (as described in our </span><a href="https://discord.com/terms#6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Terms of Service</a>).

<p id="docs-internal-guid-94c396ed-7fff-9265-8f6d-a921495c2574"><strong>Types of Discord Apps:</strong></p>
<p>1. <strong>Bots</strong>: Automated programs that can perform a variety of tasks such as moderating chats, providing user support, playing music, or organizing games. They typically exist within a server and appear as a member of the server.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Activities</strong>: Interactive experiences like games, quizzes, or collaborative tools such as whiteboards that you can enjoy with others in real-time in text chats or voice calls. Learn more about activities in our <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4422142836759-Activities-on-Discord" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Activities on Discord Help Center</a> article.</p>
<p id="docs-internal-guid-6126a9a7-7fff-5081-c79c-fa885b14f619"><strong>Where You Can Use Apps on Discord:</strong></p>
<p>Apps on Discord can be installed in, or added to, servers by server admin or installed by users to their own accounts. </p>
<p>1. <strong>Apps added to servers</strong>: Users need to be the server owner or have the <strong>Manage Server </strong>permission enabled in order to add an app to that server. It is then available by default to all users in that server. It can also ask for permissions to do things in a server like a user, such as making channels, deleting messages, or editing roles.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Apps added to your account: </strong>When you add an app to your account, that app is then available for you to use in all your servers, DMs, and GDMs. When you use it, other users in the space may also be able to interact with it.</p>

<h1 id="h_01HRQSA6C89EVW06TR83E76S86">How to Discover Apps and Add Apps</h1>
<p>Discord’s <strong>App Directory</strong> lets you search, browse, and explore various apps you can add to customize your server. </p>
<h2 id="h_01J7CJD6JNQ78PEPF4MM4GQWF2">From the App Launcher</h2>
<p>Discord’s <strong>App Launcher</strong> lets you discover new apps through the displayed collections and search.</p>
<p>In addition to the apps already installed to your account and the server you're in (if applicable), when you open the App Launcher, you will also see collections of other apps you may want to try. These collections include a mix of user and staff favorites as well as others we think you’ll love. We may work with the developers of some of these apps to help them bring you more content and features. Sometimes this may include a partnership contract or financial relationship; we’ll identify those apps to you with the "Partner" tag.</p>
<p>Search results are ranked by factors including the relevancy to the search query and popularity based on usage.</p>
<p>Apps that you use will show up in your “Recents” and “Installed” sections at the top of the launcher. You can launch those apps immediately from inside the App Launcher by selecting them. </p>

<p><strong>Q: Who should I reach out to if I am experiencing issues with the app?</strong></p>
<p id="docs-internal-guid-230ac762-7fff-7041-c334-73d9312b28fa">A: Apps are created and operated by their developers. If you are experiencing issues with an app, please head over to the app's support server or otherwise contact their developer. Learn more about third-party services <a href="https://discord.com/terms#6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p id="docs-internal-guid-ffa5a26f-7fff-2a44-556a-6a0b2a87513f">If you believe an app is violating Discord's policies, you can also report it to us <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=12275528604823">here</a>.</p>
<p id="docs-internal-guid-0dd32b99-7fff-b746-d2c7-94cc347ec8f0">Also, if you are experiencing issues with the app, please reach out to the app’s support team by heading over to their app’s support server. Most support servers can be found within the app’s <strong>Overview</strong> section within the <strong>App Directory</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Q: Who is able to manage apps in a server?</strong></p>
<p>A: To manage apps in a server, you must be the owner of the server or have the <strong>Manage Server </strong>permissions enabled. </p>
<p><strong>Q: I no longer want the app in my server. How do I remove the app? </strong></p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-d7057733-7fff-8e82-f430-740742637230">A: To remove the app, right-click the app’s bot within the </span><strong>Members list</strong> and <strong>kick</strong> the bot. By kicking the bot from the server, the app will be removed. To remove an app from a server, you must be the owner of the server or have the <strong>Manage Server </strong>permissions enabled. If you are in a server where you want an app removed but don't have permissions, please reach out to the server admin or leave the server.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Where can I use Apps?</strong></p>
<p>A: <span id="docs-internal-guid-2580c40c-7fff-dbfd-6cde-4a9d79bdf6a2">Apps that are added directly to a server can be used within that server if the server’s permissions are set up to allow members to use that app. Apps that are added directly to a user’s account can be used in any server that the user is in.</span></p>
<p><strong>Q: How do I install an app to my account?</strong></p>
<p>A: Some apps can be installed to your account directly, instead of a server. Some developers will be updating their apps to enable this functionality. If you see an app that has this feature enabled, feel free to add the app to your account! Please note that apps that are added to your account may not have all the same capabilities as apps added to a server. <span id="docs-internal-guid-c39d8fa9-7fff-bec8-aff4-b6e0f6352beb"></span></p>
<p><strong>Q: Which apps can I use to modify images in Discord?</strong></p>
<p>A: Currently, Discord offers several apps for image modification. Viggle animates characters, esmBot adds captions or creates bouncing animations, Picsar transforms images into stickers, and Nekotina generates image descriptions. More apps may become available in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Q: My server utilizes AutoMod. Will messages from application commands be affected or flagged by AutoMod?</strong></p>
<p>A: AutoMod will not flag messages from apps that you’ve installed onto your server.</p>
<p>AutoMod will only flag messages from apps that are installed directly onto a user’s account. Any actions taken by AutoMod will happen on the user who installed the application and first used it in a server. This means if an application creates a message with buttons, additional messages created from interacting with those buttons will also action against the user who used the command initially.</p>
<p id="docs-internal-guid-e85834a2-7fff-0283-d839-1b1aa05d5e5b"><strong>Q: What data can an app access about me or my server or DM, or the people in it?</strong></p>
<p>A: Apps you’ve added to your account can access your information that you've authorized. These apps are not able to access information about your server or DMs. They also do not have permissions to take action in your server or DMs, other than responding to your interactions. Additionally, user installed apps are not able to get information about members of your servers or DMs that have not used the app. If a user does choose to interact with the app (e.g., through buttons and select menus), then the app can access their basic user information, like their username, user ID, avatar, and (if in a server) your server nickname, roles, and permissions. </p>
<p>Apps added to servers can access data as generally described <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/7933951485975-Visibility-of-Bot-Data-Access" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p>To learn more about a specific app's data practices, please refer to the app’s developer or its privacy policy.</p>
