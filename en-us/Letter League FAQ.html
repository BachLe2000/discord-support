<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Letter League is an <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/4422142836759" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Activity</a> that we've developed here at Discord. Letter League is a game where you and your friends take turns placing letters on a shared game board to create words in a crossword-style. Spelling words with high earning letters and placing letters on special spaces earn players more points, so get your dictionaries and thesauri ready!</span></p>

<h3 id="docs-internal-guid-b3af4c01-7fff-1dc5-74c2-c35d85e9187a"><span style="color: #434343;">These instructions may look slightly different on mobile. </span></h3>
<h3 id="h_01HRQVJBGHZHSBN0908FD429DQ"><span style="color: #434343;">Note: When playing with more than 20 people you may experience some technical issues. For the best experience, we recommend games with up to 6 players. </span></h3>
<p>1. After launching the game, you can adjust your game settings by selecting the <strong>hamburger</strong> icon in the upper right-hand corner and the <strong>cogwheel</strong> button to navigate to <strong>Edit Game Settings</strong>. </p>
<p>While there, you can select the length, scoring, and the timer settings you would like to set for your game.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span id="docs-internal-guid-fa741d3d-7fff-599e-1ae3-454d8db45f5f"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/21993298408471" width="611" height="344"></span></p>
<p id="docs-internal-guid-ffdda9f2-7fff-7287-15ec-10e00e04484a">2. You can also choose between two different scoring settings: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Wild</strong>: The default setting, when a letter is multiplied it keeps its improved score. Letters will be colored in to show which multipliers have been applied to them, so the next time someone scores big you can use those new and improved letters for yourself. </li>
<li>
<strong>Classic</strong>: Letters each have a point value in the lower right. When you play a word, you score the points of all the letters you used. Play letters on multiplier squares to get higher scores!  </li>
</ul>
<p>For this example, we will be playing <strong>Wild</strong></p>
<p>3. Once the game begins, use the set of letters located near the bottom to create words by selecting a tile and then selecting its destination or dragging it there.</p>

<p id="docs-internal-guid-dedc4b61-7fff-de0e-3819-a89bf648eaf7">The numbers on each tile represents the amount of points you would score when placing those letters on those tiles. You can increase your scoring by placing your letters on squares that improve your word’s total score. </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span id="docs-internal-guid-f87c0a14-7fff-3543-0c42-fe01ff1460f6"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/21993298432663" width="348" height="174"></span></p>
<p id="docs-internal-guid-302a9df4-7fff-4b63-0085-d8cc8319c7b2">4. If a player is unable to form a valid word, they can either swap their tiles by pressing the <strong>Swap</strong> button located above their set of letters, or they must pass their turn by selecting the <strong>Pass Turn </strong>button located underneath the timer.</p>

<h1 id="h_01F4ZHYENSF3VFJR8BEMF8ZPC2">Letter League FAQ</h1>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: Why is Discord adding games into voice channels?</strong></span></p>
<p>A: We started Discord because we are all about bringing people together around gaming. As Discord has grown, we've seen more and more people use Discord to come together around games. For instance, we’ve seen people use Discord to not only play <em>League</em> but also to hang out and play more casual, social games with friends like <em>Jackbox</em> and <em>Among Us</em>.</p>
