<p>A Data Package is a ZIP folder of files that you can request through your <strong>User Settings</strong> that contains all of your Discord data for your account. This includes messages, current servers you’re in, activity, and more. The files within the ZIP folder are JSON files that can be opened easily in Notepad on Windows or through Textedit on MacOS. You can also drag and drop them into a browser like Chrome or Firefox. CSV files can easily be opened in Excel or Google Sheets.</p>
