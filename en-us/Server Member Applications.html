<div class="exp-box">The <strong>server member applications </strong>feature is rolling out gradually and can only be enabled through the desktop app. However, users applying for a server can submit or withdraw their applications using either desktop or mobile devices.</div>
<p>People can join your server in three ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/208866998-Invites-101" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Invite only</a></li>
<li>Through <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360023968311-Server-Discovery" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discovery</a>
</li>
<li>Member application</li>
</ul>
<p>Using member applications, server owners can precisely control who joins their server. Simply navigate to your <strong>Access </strong>settings, by pressing the <strong>server name</strong> in the upper-left corner. Then select <strong>Server Settings &gt; Access</strong>.</p>

<h1 id="h_01JK8ZT53MYSBZS4FAJYB7ZAFQ">How to Configure Server Join Settings</h1>
<p>In <strong>Access </strong>settings, you can control your server's privacy level by choosing how people join. Select either <strong>Invite Only</strong>, <strong>Apply to Join</strong>, or <strong>Discoverable</strong> under the <strong>How can people join your server?</strong> section.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/29747454735255" width="922" height="706"></p>

<h2 id="h_01JK8ZT53M7SGVKV023S720A6C">Invite Only</h2>
<p><strong>Invite Only</strong> is the default privacy setting for all Discord servers. This gives you maximum control over who joins your server:</p>
<ul>
<li>Members can only join through valid <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/208866998-Invites-101" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">invite links</a>
</li>
<li>Enable server rules to require new members to accept your server guidelines before participating</li>
<li>Generate <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001542132-Custom-Invite-Link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="wysiwyg-underline" style="color: #1155cc;">customized invite links</span></a> with expiration dates and usage limits</li>

<div class="info-box">While applications are pending, users cannot view any server content.</div>
<p>With the <strong>Apply to Join</strong> option, you can screen potential members by requiring them to complete an application form before joining your server. Here's what you need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>All applications must be reviewed and approved by server administrators before members can join</li>
<li>Create custom questions to ensure new members are a good fit for your community</li>
<li>Choose whether to display application links on server profiles for easier discovery</li>
</ul>

<div class="info-box">
<strong>NOTE</strong>: Server members who have the <strong>Kick Members</strong> permission enabled can create special invite links that bypass the application process. These invite links can be viewed in <strong>Server Settings &gt; Invites</strong>.</div>
<h2 id="h_01JK8ZT53MBGK8A2515XYTAKXH">Discoverable</h2>
<p>The <strong>Discoverable</strong> option lets you enable <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360023968311-Server-Discovery" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Server Discovery</a>, making your server visible to all Discord users who are searching for new communities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your server must be set up as a<a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047132851-Enabling-Your-Community-Server" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Community server</a> to be discoverable</li>
<li>You'll need to meet <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360030843331-Enabling-Server-Discovery" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord's discovery eligibility requirements</a> including safety standards</li>

<h1 id="h_01JK8ZT53M0HGHFJ7EKBC43SHH">Reviewing Server Member Applications</h1>

You can learn more about the Members page <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/15946797617431-Members-Page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<p>You will be able to review the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why they would like to join your server</li>
<li>When they joined Discord</li>
