<p>You can now have custom Discord Tags with a <strong>Nitro subscription</strong>!</p>
<h1>Limitations with Discord Tags</h1>
<p>Before we start, there is some important information you should know about custom Discord Tags</p>
<ol>
<li>You can claim any Tag that is available for your username. Every username+Tag combo must be unique, so we can't guarantee that a Tag will be available for you</li>
<li>Valid tags are 4-digit numbers between #0001 and #9999</li>
<li>If you choose a custom Tag, your Tag will remain while your Nitro subscription is active. If your subscription lapses, your Tag will be <strong>randomized</strong>. We don't save your old Tag, so it won't just revert to an old one</li>
<li>There is a rate limit on how often you can change your Username or Tag. If you hit a rate-limited error, try again in an hour!</li>
</ol>
<h1>Changing your Discord Tag</h1>
<p>To change your Discord Tag, navigate to your User Settings and click the <strong>Edit</strong> button.</p>
<p>From there, you'll notice that your Discord Tag is editable!</p>

<p>Change your Discord Tag to a new four-digit number between 0001 and 9999 (yes, you can have 0001 too)</p>
<p>Enter your current password and click <strong>save</strong>. </p>
<p>You'll see a confirmation window warning you that ending your Nitro subscription will result in your custom Tag being randomized again.</p>
