<h1 id="h_01GFV5SGYJM37SG12BRM7HQSCC">How do I get local pricing?</h1>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get localized pricing, you must have a payment method based in a country where Discord offers localized pricing. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">JCB, Discover, Diners Club, UnionPay, and AMEX currently do not support localized pricing. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, certain Brazilian banks do not support BRL.</span></em>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are using an eligible payment method, you will automatically switch to the new price + currency. The change will take effect at your next billing cycle.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you use a payment method that does not support, or are located in a region where Discord doesn't offer localized pricing, our system will automatically charge in USD instead.</span></li>

<h1 id="h_01GFV5T5AWPB202ZXZ3Z8MNJ9D"><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h1>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: What about other countries?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: We’re always looking to improve Nitro, but we have no updates to share on pricing in other countries at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: I’m a desktop subscriber in one of these countries, how come I don’t have localized prices?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: Go to the Subscriptions page - if you don’t see the localized price listed for your subscription, make sure you have a valid payment method and that the payment method is issued by a bank in one of the eligible countries. You should then receive a popup asking you to confirm your localized price.  </span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: How can I see if I am receiving a localized price?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: The desktop subscriptions settings page will show you what price you are receiving for Nitro. If it doesn’t currently show the localized price, you may still be eligible. </span>Please note that only certain Nitro tiers are eligible for localized pricing at this time, not all.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: When does the new price take effect?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: At your next billing cycle. </span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: Do Nitro Gifts have localized pricing?</strong></span></p>
<p id="docs-internal-guid-f10ad139-7fff-756c-5fe8-13ca8a7234b9">A: At this time - all gifted items, including items from the Shop and Nitro gifts of all tiers, will be under the same prices as USD. However, you may be eligible to pay the equivalent to the USD price in your local currency if the option is available in your region.</p>
<p>If local currency options for a gift are not available for any reason, the transaction will default to USD.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: Q: I still can’t pay for my Discord purchases, subscriptions, or memberships because [X] (e.g. you don’t accept my payment method).<br></strong></span></p>
<p id="docs-internal-guid-e6d6ff31-7fff-3aeb-c59f-75e4982ee818">A: We’re trying to improve support for purchasing Discord subscriptions and memberships, including Nitro, Nitro Basic, and Server Boosting, as well as purchases from the Discord shop in various countries. </p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: Why were there additional fees or taxes on my purchase in a localized pricing country?<br></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: When making a purchase in a country where localized pricing is available, mandatory fees and/or taxes may be imposed. Please reach out to your bank or payment processor if you have questions about taxes or fees.</span></p>
<p id="docs-internal-guid-31dfde35-7fff-a62f-5a18-608493587f29"><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"> Q: Why was I charged in USD for my purchase despite being in a region where localized pricing is available?</span></strong></p>
<p>A: To clarify, you may have been charged in USD for a purchase (including Nitro, Server Boosts, or Shop items) despite localized pricing being available in your region for any of the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your payment method on file does not originate from the proper region where localized pricing is available.</li>
<li>Your payment method does not support the currency you’re attempting to pay with (for example, PayPal.)</li>
<li>You’re using a VPN, which may affect proper recognition of your location.</li>
<li>You’re purchasing through a third party vendor, such as Google Play, that does not support transactions in all currencies.</li>
<li>You purchased a gift. Gifts are not currently available in all localized prices, and will cost the equivalent of the USD price, or default to USD, depending on your region.</li>
<li>You manually selected USD as your currency in the “Pay for it with” menu during the checkout process.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: My bank in Brazil won't process my payment in BRL. What should I do?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: We are aware of this issue and working on a fix with our payment providers. We apologize for any inconvenience! In the meantime, you can try switching to an alternative payment method, which may resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: I purchased a Nitro/Nitro Classic Monthly or Yearly subscription before localized pricing became available in my country. Can I get a refund?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: We are happy to issue a refund for your purchase if it falls within our</span> <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012668071" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Refund Policy</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If your purchase falls within the refund policy, you can reach out to our support team here to request a refund:</span> <a href="http://dis.gd/billing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dis.gd/billing</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your purchase falls outside the refund policy, our team is unable to issue a refund. However, your subscription will automatically be updated to the new localized price upon the next renewal date. We appreciate your understanding!</span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: Why did the PLN pricing in Poland change after December 14, 2022?</strong></span></p>
<p>A: To clarify, on December 14, 2022, we grandfathered our previous Polish prices as we expanded Euro pricing availability to our Polish users.</p>
<p>If you subscribed to Nitro, Nitro Classic, or Server Boosting before this date, <strong>you will keep your current pricing as long as you don't make any further subscription changes</strong>. Such changes include changing the frequency at which you are billed (yearly or monthly) or the tier of your subscription (for example, going from Nitro to Nitro Classic).</p>
<p>If you’d like to cancel your subscription, you can do so by going to User Settings &gt; Subscriptions. However, keep in mind that canceling your subscription will also result in a loss of grandfathered prices once your subscription ends.</p>
<p id="docs-internal-guid-38183b86-7fff-6a02-d75c-6146c3ef19c4"><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: Is localized pricing available for ARS/Argentina?</strong></span></p>
<p>A: As of February 15, 2024, we began the deprecation of ARS pricing and it is no longer available when purchasing Nitro, Nitro Basic, Nitro Classic, and/or Server Boosting. If you are a Discord user in Argentina and currently have a Nitro, Nitro Basic, Nitro Classic, and/or Server Boosting subscription, you will receive a notification of this change through the email associated with your Discord account about how this change will impact your subscription.</p>
<p>If you would like to cancel your Discord subscription, you can go to your <strong>User Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Subscription</strong> to cancel your current subscription(s).</p>
<p id="docs-internal-guid-592992ef-7fff-43d1-21d0-432540a7e607"><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: Did the TRY/Turkey pricing change for Discord subscriptions?</strong></span></p>
<p>A: On February 21, 2024, we made a price adjustment to the TRY pricing for our Discord subscriptions, which is in effect for all new purchases of Nitro, Nitro Basic, and Nitro Classic in Turkey. For current subscribers of Nitro, Nitro Basic, and Nitro Classic in Turkey, you should see a notification of this change through the email associated with your Discord account about its impact on your subscription.</p>
<p>If you would like to cancel your Discord subscription, you can go to your <strong>User Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Subscriptions</strong> to cancel your current subscription(s).</p>
<p>If you are currently subscribed to Nitro, Nitro Basic, and Nitro Classic through the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store and you are based in Turkey with the TRY pricing, you will maintain the legacy subscription prices so long as you are still subscribed through the mobile app.</p>
