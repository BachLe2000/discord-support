<h1>New Mobile App Layout</h1>
<p>Hello there! If you’ve found your way to this Help Center article, you’ve likely gained access to a new mobile layout that we are testing with a limited number of users. If you’ve been using Discord for a while now, you probably noticed the mobile layout was designed to reflect the desktop layout. With this new iteration of Discord on mobile, we hope to make the mobile experience feel like it was optimized for your mobile device rather than a scaled-down desktop app. The new mobile design aims to simplify and improve the Discord experience for everyone by creating a more organized, more streamlined, and better-looking mobile app that helps you get to your chats quickly and easily. </p>
<p>We’re actively gathering feedback during the testing period to ensure that we continue to provide the best experience on Discord. Be sure to explore the new mobile layout and give it a heartfelt try. And if it doesn’t work, that’s okay — you’re welcome to turn it off and go back to the old look (more on that below), but we’d love to know how your experience went. If something doesn’t work for you, please let us know so we can continue to improve upon this new mobile app design!</p>
<p>This Help Center article will explain the core changes to the mobile layout, how you can provide feedback and thoughts on what does or doesn’t work for you, and how to opt out if you prefer.</p>

<p>In the new mobile layout, your servers are in their own dedicated “Servers” tab, located at the bottom-left corner of the app.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img style="text-align: center;" src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/12729262117655" alt="servers.png" width="309" height="669"></p>

<li>A game your friend is playing.</li>
<li>If your friend is participating in any activity that supports Rich Presence, like listening to Spotify or watching something on Crunchyroll.</li>
