<p>We provide age verification to help users manage content filter settings and sensitive content visibility. This one-time process can be completed when you first adjust these settings, with the option to re-verify if needed.</p>
<div class="exp-box">The age verification features described are an experiment and available only to users in the United Kingdom and Australia.</div>

<h1 id="h_01JQ4N4R4K238K45JTARQVK2CN">Why do I need to verify my age group?</h1>
<p>Some Discord settings and content are designed for certain age groups. We're experimenting with a streamlined way for you to verify your age group when you try to access those settings or content.</p>
<div class="info-box">
<strong>NOTE</strong>: Age verification is required to unblur media flagged by our sensitive media filter and to update your sensitive media filter settings.</div>
<h1 id="h_01JQWGF3DAAB04W64D7E2NVFKW">When do I need to verify my age?</h1>
<p>You may be asked to verify your age in two situations:</p>
<p>1. When you encounter content flagged by our sensitive media filter, you may need to verify your age group.</p>

<p>The age verification process works the same way, regardless of how it is triggered. Here’s how to verify to verify your age group:</p>
<p>1. When you encounter blurred sensitive content or try to change content filter settings, you'll be prompted to verify your age if you haven't done so already. <span style="color: #1f1f1f; background-color: #ffffff;">This requirement applies to users who haven't verified their age and are included in this experiment.</span></p>

<h1 id="h_01JQ4N9Y8E96WFDRN01KC81VTP">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<p><strong>Q: Is my data stored when I use Face Scan or ID verification?</strong></p>
<p>A: The information you share to power the age verification method that you choose is only used for the one-time age verification process and is not stored by Discord or its vendor. For Face Scan, the solution our vendor uses operates on-device, which means there is no collection of any biometric information when you scan your face. For ID verification, the scan of your ID is deleted upon verification.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Do I need to verify my age to access content flagged by our Sensitive Media Filter and settings?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, age verification is required before you can access that flagged content and the sensitive media filter settings.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Do I need to verify my age multiple times to change the settings for the Sensitive Media Filter?</strong></p>
<p>A: No. Age verification is a one-time process. Once your age group is confirmed, you won't need to verify again when you attempt to access an age-restricted feature. However, if you believe your age group is incorrect, you may retry the age verification process again.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What happens if my age group is verified incorrectly or it fails to verify.</strong></p>
<p>A: You have two options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Retry verification through your chat with Discord system messages where you can select <strong>Retry </strong>to enter the verification flow again.</li>
<li>You can retry by opting for a <strong>manual review </strong><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000029731" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a><strong>. </strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Q: How long does verification take?</strong></p>
<p>A: The verification process typically takes just a few minutes. You'll receive notifications about the status and a DM from Discord's official profile once completed.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What happens if I’m banned after age verification?</strong></p>
