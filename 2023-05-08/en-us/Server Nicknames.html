<p>One of the awesome things about Discord is that you're not just crammed into one small group of friends. You can join many different servers for all sorts of different purposes, class discussions, communities, secret societies, the choice is yours.</p>
<p>With Server Nicknames, you can customize your name in each server that you're in (<em>as long as you've been granted the right permissions</em>)!</p>

<h1 id="h_01EJTEH9GD2Q0HV92SJ17F5NKC">What Role Permissions Do You Need? </h1>
<p>There are two role permissions dedicated to nickname usage:</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360092827753/Screen_Shot_2020-09-22_at_12.15.39_AM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2020-09-22_at_12.15.39_AM.png" width="605" height="222"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Change Nickname</strong></span>
<ul>
<li>Enabling this permission will allows a user to change their own nickname in the server.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Manage Nickname</strong> </span>
<ul>
<li>Enabling this permission will allow a user to change other server members' nicknames within that server.</li>
<li>This permission is useful for server moderation purposes if a moderator ever needs to manually changes someone's nickname! </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>If you're a server member</strong></span>, you'll need to have a role that has the <strong>Change Nickname</strong> permission in order to change your own nickname in the server!</p>
<h3>Note: If you don't have this permission, double check with the server owner or administrators to see if they can change your role's permission settings! </h3>
<h1 id="h_01EJTEHFA19Q5BK1GQY2XJ2ZJS">How to Change A Nickname</h1>
<p>If you have the <strong>Change Nickname</strong> permissions in the server, you can now officially choose a new nickname! You can change your nickname using a couple of different methods in the server!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h2 id="h_01EJTEHMJK0MM58PN56VG0M6DD"><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">In the Member's List</span></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're on the browser or desktop app, right-click your own username in the Server Member List (in the right side bar) and you'll see a drop down menu appear!</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-color-black">Press </span>on the <span class="wysiwyg-color-black"><strong>Edit Server Profile</strong></span> option, and you'll see a new menu pop up where you can type in a new nickname of your choice! </p>
<p>When you're happy with your new nickname, press the <strong>Save</strong> button to confirm your changes! </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/4409550058263/Server-Nickname-Member-List-Edit-Server-Profile-demo.gif" alt="Server-Nickname-Member-List-Edit-Server-Profile-demo.gif" width="679" height="359"></p>
<h3>Note: if you have the Manage Nickname permission, you can use similar steps to change another server member's nickname! All you have to do is right-click the specific user's username in the Member's List instead to start the process! </h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h2 id="h_01EJTEHRT6W0VF992C4H79KQGS"><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Within the Text Channel</span></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes if you're in a very large server, you might not be able to easily find your username in the Member's list,</p>
<p>Don't fear! You can also right-click your own avatar/username on a recent message that you've sent within the text channel to see the <span class="wysiwyg-color-black"><strong>Edit Server Profile</strong></span> option in the dropdown menu! </p>
<p>Once you've pressed on that option, all you'll need to do is fill out your new nickname and then press <strong>Save</strong>! </p>

<h3>Note: if you have the Manage Nickname permission, you can use similar steps to change another server member's nickname! All you have to do is right-click the specific user's username/avatar in the text channel instead to start the process! </h3>

<h2 id="h_01EJTEHX685ZZGGJZJCB6X1KCY"><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Using a Slash Command in the Text Channel</span></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Last but not least, if you're a fan of slash commands, typing the command '/nick' and then entering your nickname will have the same effect!</p>
<p>For example, to change my nickname to Picasso, I would type: </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><strong>/nick Picasso</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">And then send that message in the text channel for Clyde to update my nickname! </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360090695234/Screen_Shot_2020-09-22_at_1.10.43_AM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2020-09-22_at_1.10.43_AM.png" width="653" height="208"></p>
<h3>
<span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong></span> If the server owner has denied your role the "Change Nickname" permission, then none of these methods will work. <br>The "Change Nickname" selection in the menu won't appear, and Clyde will have a sad message for you:<img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360092828973/Screen_Shot_2020-09-22_at_12.41.56_AM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2020-09-22_at_12.41.56_AM.png">

<p>Keep in mind that even if you're going incognito with another nickname, anyone can still click on your User Profile and see your true Discord Tag.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360092836353/Screen_Shot_2020-09-22_at_1.12.18_AM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2020-09-22_at_1.12.18_AM.png" width="346" height="482"></p>
<p>The good news about nicknames is that normal Discord features that require you to know someone's username will still apply as normal. You can use either their username or nickname to <strong>@mention</strong> them:</p>
<p><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360090703054/Screen_Shot_2020-09-22_at_1.18.53_AM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2020-09-22_at_1.18.53_AM.png"></p>
<p>This also applies to searching for users in the <strong>Server Settings &gt; Members </strong>tab too!</p>
