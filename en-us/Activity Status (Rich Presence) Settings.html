<h1 id="h_01HGXNM713J5VYHFGNKFD3180C">What is Activity Status?</h1>
<p>An activity status is automatically displayed when you’re participating in an activity that supports rich presence (like listening to <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000167212-" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spotify</a>), playing a game, or if you’re attending a public Stage. This will display both as your status in a server, but also in your profile and mini profile. </p>
<p>Here are just some of the products that can be displayed through your activity status:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003953831-" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox</a></li>
