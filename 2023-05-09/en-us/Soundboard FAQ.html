<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/12931011736343" alt="soundboard_example.gif"></p>
<p>Soundboard is a voice channel feature that allows you to play a short audio clip that can be heard by all participants in the same voice channel. Much like Reactions and Super Reactions, Soundboard is a way for you to express yourself and react to the voice channel’s  conversation or Go Live stream.</p>
<h2 id="docs-internal-guid-98910e3a-7fff-d156-b753-835d493e7571">Server Boost Soundboard</h2>
<p>Servers have 8 preloaded sound slots for server members to start using Soundboard. Additional slots can be unlocked based on the server’s tier level with <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028038352" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Server Boosting</a>.</p>
<p>Tier 1: <strong>24 slots</strong></p>
<p>Tier 2: <strong>35 slots</strong></p>
<p>Tier 3: <strong>48 slots</strong></p>
<h1 id="h_01GTYZSGZ15S6B5RVD4W8EZWG9">How do I use Soundboard?</h1>
<p>1. Navigate to a server and join your intended voice channel.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/12931074785431" alt="image5.png"></p>
<p>2. While in the voice channel, fully pull up the channel so that you can see everyone’s Avatars. If Soundboard is enabled, you should see a music icon on the bottom left. Press on the icon to open up Soundboard. If a user is deafened in the channel, they will not hear the sound play.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/12931069480599" alt="image6.png"></p>
<p>3. Another way to access Soundboard when in a voice channel is by pressing the Soundboard icon on the bottom left while connected.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/12931069880727" alt="image8.png"></p>
<p>4. With  Soundboard open, you can hover over any current available sound and then press <strong>Play</strong> to play that sound. Pressing <strong>Play</strong> will play the sound for everyone in the voice channel to hear.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/12931076069655" alt="image10.png"></p>

<h2 id="h_01GTYZSNM9T3V440WDB2SVEVDX">How can I upload new sounds to the server’s Soundboard?</h2>
