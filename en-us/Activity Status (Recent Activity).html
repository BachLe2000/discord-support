<h1 id="h_01HTJA8QV5YFRR10TQ9RBZM8SS">What is Activity Status (Recent Activity)?</h1>
<p>When you engage in certain detectable activities (like playing a game or listening to music), Discord can display information about those activities. This includes when and how you engaged, as well as information about the activity. Some examples of the types of activity we show:</p>
<ol>
<li>Detectable games you’re playing on a computer</li>
<li>Games you’re playing on <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003953831-Discord-and-Xbox-Connection-FAQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox</a> or <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4419534960919-Discord-and-PlayStation-Network-Connection-FAQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Playstation</a>

<li><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/9929188048023-Discord-and-Crunchyroll-Connection-FAQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crunchyroll</a></li>

</li>
<li>And more!</li>
</ol>
<p>Games and activities that support Rich Presence will show even more cool stuff about what’s happening in the activity. </p>
<p>And some activities from other services like Spotify or Crunchyroll require you to connect your account to Discord. You can learn more about these through our connections article <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/8063233404823-Connections-Linked-Roles-Community-Members" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. </p>
<h1 id="h_01HTJA8QV5TNKJRY98GXQSHJQQ">How to View Activity Status</h1>
<p>Activity can be seen in multiple places within the Discord app.</p>
<h2 id="h_01HTJA8QV5GP22NWFTXYNKW3GX">Within User Profiles</h2>
<p>When viewing your User Profile, you will be able to see your Recent Activity history within the last 30 days.</p>
<div class="exp-box">
<strong>Note: </strong>Recent Activity history is an experimental feature available to a limited number of users. While all users can view, manage, and delete their own Recent Activity history, only those added to this experiment can view others' Recent Activity history. You can learn more about <a href="#h_01J5NNZS153N6H9V1S5A6WMMPK">Recent Activity history below</a>.</div>

<h2 id="h_01HTJA8QV59M70ZB3DY4THZM27">On Global Activity Cards</h2>
<p>You can also view the <strong>activity cards</strong> in the <strong>Messages</strong> tab on mobile or the <strong>Friends List </strong>on desktop. These will show you recent activity of Friends and people you interact with in your servers.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><strong><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/22536176540567" width="610" height="332">   </strong><strong><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/22536176546711" width="163" height="338"></strong></p>

<h2 id="h_01HTJA8QV5ZFGKBM8QNZA4S4JZ">As a Status Message </h2>
<p>While in a server, the activity status may appear as a status in the Members list depending on your settings.</p>
<p id="h_01HTJA8QV500D229RX3F47SAG8" class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><strong><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/22536161076375" width="624" height="408"></strong></p>
<h1 id="h_01HTJA8QV5EZK2YFH8G4T6JD9D">How do I control who sees my activity?</h1>
<p>By default in most regions, your current and recent activity can be viewed by your friends or other users who are in the same server as you. You can control this in a few ways.</p>
<h2 id="h_01HTJA8QV5H72HKXSNDXME2NAS">Global Settings</h2>
<p>In your global settings, you can control whether <span id="docs-internal-guid-7ef7295c-7fff-9316-a504-ae87397e3212">detectable games or applications that support rich presence are shown</span><span id="docs-internal-guid-7434bd74-7fff-ebef-f9c5-bf5a5eeedf33"> to others, regardless of whether they’re friends or not. </span></p>
<p>1. Tap on <strong>cogwheel</strong> [<img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/22536161088791" width="23" height="24">] next to your Discord username to access your <strong>User Settings</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Then, select <strong>Activity Privacy </strong>where you will find your <strong>Activity Status</strong> settings.</p>
<p>3. Here you can enable or disable your activity status by toggling the following settings: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Share your activity with others: </strong>This toggle controls whether or not anyone on Discord can see your activity status. </li>
<li>
<strong>Share your activity status by default when joining large servers: </strong>This toggle allows your activity status to automatically display as a status message in the members list in servers you join.</li>
</ul>
<p>If enabled, you’ll see a check mark [<img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/22536161098775" width="27" height="24">]. If disabled, you’ll see an [<img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/22536161114903" width="25" height="24">] instead.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/22536161120535" width="624" height="425"></p>
<div class="info-box">In certain countries and situations, this setting might be disabled by default for you. You can always change your settings by following the instructions above.</div>
<h2 id="h_01HTJA8QV5M1VHRW89M024JHDT">Connections Settings</h2>
<p>For any connected accounts that support sharing recent activity or rich presence, you’ll see a toggle to share your activity with others in the <strong>Connections</strong> menu located within your <strong>User Settings &gt; Connections</strong>. </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/22536176616599" width="624" height="264"></p>
<p>You can enable or disable each individual connection.</p>
<h2 id="h_01HTJA8QV5ABSA6FY6GEPMA946">Game Detection</h2>
<p>You can enable or disable individual games from being displayed as activity in the <strong>Registered Games</strong> menu located within your <strong>User Settings &gt; </strong>under <strong>Activity Settings</strong>. Activity will be shared as long as the global setting is also on.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/22536176626583" width="624" height="237"></p>
<h2 id="h_01HTJA8QV57FRX82WP3T41Z3G8">Per-server Control</h2>
<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Note:</strong> Activity Status is automatically enabled for servers you join. However, you can adjust this default setting for servers with over 200 members in your Global Settings menu.</div>
<p>If you want to control which servers can see your recent activity, you can disable or enable settings per server.</p>
<p>1. Navigate to the server where you would like to enable or disable the Activity Status settings.</p>
<p>2. Right-click the server’s name or select the dropdown menu. </p>
<p>3. Then, select <strong>Privacy Settings</strong>. This will give you the option to toggle the <strong>Activity Status</strong> setting.   </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/22536161154967" width="624" height="425"></p>
<div class="info-box">
<strong>Note:</strong> <br>- Members of a disabled server will still be able to see your activity if they’re also friends with you or if they share another server with you where your activity is allowed.<br>- Although the Activity Status may be turned off for a specific server, you’ll still see the status on your end unless you have it fully disabled.</div>
<div class="exp-box">For the experiment that displays Activity Cards in a server’s Members List, the server-specific privacy settings will not affect the experiment at this time. The activity shown in that experiment features are controlled by global, connection, and game-level controls within Discord.</div>
