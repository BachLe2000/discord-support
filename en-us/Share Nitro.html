<h1 id="h_01HVRY7E8T0ADKKTYZWQXHSE7D">FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h1>
<p><strong>Q: As a Nitro member, who can I share Nitro trials with?</strong></p>
<p>A: As a Nitro member, you can share Nitro trials with any eligible friend. If a friend appears in the <strong>Select Friends </strong>list in the Share Nitro experience, they are eligible to receive and redeem a Nitro trial from you.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I just subscribed to Nitro but don’t seem to be able to share Nitro trials with others - why? </strong></p>
<p>A: Share Nitro is only available to a limited number of users. </p>
<p>For those who have access, you must be a paying Nitro member for at least 5 days to see the <strong>Share Nitro banner</strong> and share trials with others. If you’re a new Nitro member, you’ll be able to share Nitro trials with others after 5 days.<br>Additionally, you may not see it due to the eligibility criteria for Nitro members. </p>
<p><strong>Q: What happens after I share all 3 of my trials? </strong></p>
<p>A: We hope to provide more sharing opportunities in the future. Keep an eye on the Share Nitro banner in <strong>Direct Messages &gt; Nitro </strong>for when you get a refresh! </p>
<p><strong>Q: As a Nitro member, do my trials expire?</strong></p>
<p>A: No, your trials will not expire so long as you have an active Nitro membership. Once a trial is redeemed by a friend, you won’t be able to share another until you get more - or you have some left over that were not previously redeemed. </p>
<p><strong>Q: As a trial recipient, will I be charged for redeeming a gifted trial?</strong></p>
<p>A: You <strong>will not</strong> be charged for redeeming a shared trial. However, once your trial period ends, you will be charged for the plan that you signed up for during the Start Trial process. </p>

Cancel anytime during your trial to avoid being charged after your trial period in <strong>User Settings &gt; Subscriptions &gt; Cancel</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What happens if someone doesn’t redeem the Nitro trial I shared with them?</strong></p>
