<p>Discord has launched an integration for game developers to power various social and communication features within their games. For you, it means some aspects of your in-game experience (such as in-game voice or friends lists) will be powered by Discord.</p>
<p>This means you can enjoy everything you love about Discord directly in your game, even without a Discord account. Connect and play with friends through seamless cross-platform messaging, voice chat, and other powerful features. It’s never been easier to keep the party going—whether you’re actively playing or just hanging out.</p>
