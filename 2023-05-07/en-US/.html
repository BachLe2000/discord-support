<h1><strong>What is Snowsgiving?</strong></h1>

This year, we’re offering an assortment of snowy surprises for the festive season, so make sure to check out the Snowsgiving page at </span><a href="https://discord.com/snowsgiving" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Discord website</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
