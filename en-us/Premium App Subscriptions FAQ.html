<p id="docs-internal-guid-10e4f238-7fff-01bc-aff6-648c4d31d95b"><span style="color: #2e3338;"><strong>Premium App Subscriptions</strong> are a monthly subscription to premium features of an app that any individual member or server admin in a server can purchase to get enhanced functionality and more commands for the app. Any Discord user can purchase a user subscription for an app and personally utilize it in any server the user and app are both part of, while a server admin can purchase a guild subscription for an app that can be used by server members across the entire server. At the discretion of the developer of the app, subscriptions can be divided up into tiers and each tier may have unique pricing and features.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #2e3338;">Developers of the apps provide the premium subscriptions and features. They are responsible for creating the offerings and their descriptions, and they also provide the subscriptions themselves and any associated content or other features. Please read the tier descriptions carefully to make sure you understand what exactly you are buying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because these are a recurring subscription, we’ll charge you monthly until you cancel the subscription (which you can do any time as further described below).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are unhappy with your Premium App Subscription, try contacting the developer of the app directly. If that doesn’t resolve your issue, you can request a refund <a href="#h_01GFK3DZ3PGJ0DKGE61VEK5J51">as described below</a>. If you experience technical issues with Discord that prevent you from accessing your Premium App Subscription, reach out to us at <a href="https://dis.gd/billing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dis.gd/billing</a> and choose “<strong>Premium Apps</strong>” under Type of billing issue. If you experience technical issues with an app, please contact the developer of the app.</span></p>
