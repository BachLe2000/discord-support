<h1 id="h_01FYWWNGTFY94TKW46M75TEHF5"><strong>WHAT IS LAND-IO?</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/4422142836759" target="_self">Land-io</a>, players claim territory by moving around, making trails, and enclosing plots of land to gain them as their own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal is to have the most land claimed when game time runs out, but watch out for other players! If someone runs into your trail, you'll lose all the land you've collected."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The player with the most land at the end of the 5 minutes wins the game.</span></p>

<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: Why is Discord adding games into voice channels?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: We started Discord because we are all about bringing people together around gaming. As Discord has grown, we've seen more and more people use our platform to come together around games. For instance, we’ve seen people use Discord to not only play </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">League</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but also to hang out and play more casual, social games with friends like </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackbox</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among Us</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: How do I play?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: To start a game, first join one of the voice channels. Once there, you should see the Activity Launcher (it looks like a rocket ship) in the voice channel controls. Click the Activity Launcher to open the Activity Shelf, " and then select "Land-io"</span></p>
