<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sketch Heads is an <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/4422142836759" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Activity</a> that we've developed here at Discord. In Sketch Heads, players sketch pictures of a word prompt to get others to guess the prompt correctly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sketch Heads has two game modes: Classic and Blitz. Classic mode is a competitive battle against your friends where you take turns choosing a secret word to draw while everyone else competes to guess it as fast as possible! Blitz mode is a chaotic, cooperative race against the clock where you split into two teams, Drawers and Guessers. Drawers share a canvas and rapidly draw words while the Guessers guess as many as possible before the time runs out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you just wanna sketch around, try out Free Draw, where you can draw alone or with friends!</span></p>

<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: Why is Discord adding games into voice channels?</strong></span></p>
<p>A: We started Discord because we are all about bringing people together around gaming. As Discord has grown, we've seen more and more people use Discord to come together around games. For instance, we’ve seen people use Discord to not only play <em>League</em> but also to hang out and play more casual, social games with friends like <em>Jackbox</em> and <em>Among Us</em>.</p>
<p>For more information about Activities on Discord, go <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/4422142836759" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>!</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: Is there an age requirement?</strong></span></p>
<p>A: There is no age requirement for Sketch Heads. </p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: How do I play?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: To start a game, first join one of the voice channels. Once there, you should see the Activity Launcher (it looks like a rocket ship) in the voice channel controls. Click the Activity Launcher to open the Activity Shelf, " and then select "Sketch Heads".'</span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: Where can I report bugs and problems with the game?</strong></span></p>
<p>A: You'll be able to submit a bug report by going to <a href="https://dis.gd/bugreport">https://dis.gd/bugreport</a></p>
<p>For instructions on how bug reports should be submitted, please see our Help Center article: <a href="https://dis.gd/bugs">https://dis.gd/bugs</a> </p>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Q: How do I view/delete my Activities on Discord data? What data is tracked?</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: You can view data for Discord-developed Activities like <em>Sketch Heads</em> through the <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/360004027692" target="_self">Discord Privacy and Safety settings</a>. </span><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">To enhance the gameplay experience, Sketch Heads accesses and temporarily stores the following user data once a user joins the Activity:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discord ID</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avatar</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Username</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">User data is stored so long as the Activity remains active, even if the user leaves the Activity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once all users leave the Activity and it is determined the Activity has ended, the user data is deleted and no longer retained by Sketch Heads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: Didn’t Sketch Heads used to have a different name?</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: Sketch Heads used to be listed in Activities on Discord as Doodle Crew. As part of our regular updates to Activities on Discord, we gave Sketch Heads a glow-up and the name change was part of that effort.<br></span></p>
