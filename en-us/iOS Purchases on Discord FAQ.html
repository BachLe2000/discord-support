<p>When making most purchases on Discord via iOS, there are a few important considerations to keep in mind.<br>Most Discord subscriptions bought through iOS (such as a <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/115000435108-What-are-Nitro-Nitro-Basic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nitro</a>, <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/360020877112-Nitro-Gifting" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nitro gifting</a>, or <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/360028038352-Server-Boosting-FAQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Server Boost</a>) or the Apple App Store are linked to your Apple ID. This is similar to how purchases work with the <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/360055386693" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play Store</a>. Here's what you need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Discord account used for the first-time purchase of a subscription will link to the Apple ID used for the purchase.</li>
<li>Future iOS subscriptions will automatically apply to that same Discord account.</li>
<li>You cannot purchase or manage multiple subscriptions for two different Discord accounts through iOS.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to purchase a Discord subscription on iOS for a different account than the one linked to your Apple account, there are a few options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Try using a different device or Discord platform, such as the desktop app, to purchase the subscription on the secondary Discord account. </li>
<li>If you're not using your original Discord account, you can cancel the subscription tied to it and delete the account. Once both steps are complete, you will be able to use your Apple ID on the new account. <strong>Please note:</strong> the account deletion process will take up to 15 days to complete. '</li>
</ul>

<strong>Note</strong>: Discord is unable to assist with Apple subscription issues. Discord subscriptions purchased through the Apple App Store can only be managed in your Apple settings. Users can't manage these subscriptions via desktop, browser, or Android.</div>

<p><strong>Q: How do I know if my subscription is managed through Apple? </strong></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #37352f;">Q: What should I do if my Discord purchase made via iOS is marked as Past Due?</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #37352f;">A: If your Discord purchase made via iOS is marked as</span><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/23082866222871" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Past Due</a><span style="color: #37352f;">, try these steps:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #37352f;">Verify that the billing address for the charged card is up-to-date and matches your bank's information.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #37352f;">Double-check that your card details are entered correctly.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #37352f;">Make sure the card hasn't expired.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #37352f;">Ensure there are sufficient funds in the account or that you haven't exceeded the credit limit.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #37352f;">Check if you've reached a pre-set spending limit on the card.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #37352f;">If you're still having trouble processing your subscription renewal after trying these steps, contact Apple's Support team. Visit the</span><a href="https://support.apple.com/HT204084" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Apple Support page</a><span style="color: #37352f;"> and log in with the Apple ID you used for the purchase.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #37352f;">Q: I purchased a subscription (Nitro, Server Boosts, etc.) on my Apple device and would like a refund. What should I do?</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #37352f;">A: We are unable to process refunds for Discord purchases through iOS, including Nitro, Nitro Classic, Nitro Basic, gift subscriptions, and premium apps. For further assistance, please contact Apple Support by </span>visiting<a href="https://reportaproblem.apple.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> https://reportaproblem.apple.com</a> and logging in with the Apple ID used to make your purchase(s).

<p><strong><span style="color: #37352f;">Q: I made a Server Subscription purchase via iOS and would like a refund. What should I do? </span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #37352f;">A: Discord’s support team can help refund a Server Subscription purchase if the request was made within 5 days from your initial purchase date. Additionally, Server Subscription refunds are a one-time only exception.

<p><strong><span style="color: #37352f;">Q: My friend gave me a gift credit, but I have an active subscription managed through iOS. What should I do?</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #37352f;">A: Please be aware that gift credits cannot be redeemed on mobile devices. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #37352f;">To use the gift credit, you will need to cancel your current subscription through your Apple device. </span><strong><span style="color: #37352f;">Note that subscriptions do not end immediately</span></strong><span style="color: #37352f;">; they will terminate at the end of the current billing period. Once your subscription has ended, you can redeem your gift credit by subscribing to a matching subscription using the web or desktop client. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #37352f;">Q: I purchased a Nitro subscription and it's not appearing or working. What should I do?</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #37352f;">A: If you purchased a subscription directly from the Apple App Store via your Apple device, the purchase should appear under the Discord account associated with your Apple ID. Check the </span><strong><span style="color: #37352f;">User Settings &gt; Billing </span></strong><span style="color: #37352f;">tab within the Discord account you originally made purchases on.   </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #37352f;">Q: I purchased Nitro Basic and now I want to upgrade to Nitro or add additional Server Boosts to my Server Boost subscription purchased through the Apple App Store. How can I do this?</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #37352f;">A: To upgrade your subscription from Nitro Basic to Nitro, you'll need to manage it through your Apple device. Follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #37352f;">1. Open your </span><strong><span style="color: #37352f;">Settings</span></strong><span style="color: #37352f;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #37352f;">2. Select </span><strong><span style="color: #37352f;">Apple</span></strong> <strong><span style="color: #37352f;">ID</span></strong><span style="color: #37352f;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #37352f;">3. Go to </span><strong><span style="color: #37352f;">Subscriptions</span></strong><span style="color: #37352f;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #37352f;">4. Tap on the active subscription.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #37352f;">5. Select “</span><strong><span style="color: #37352f;">See all Plan Types</span></strong><span style="color: #37352f;">” and select the subscription you wish to have. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #37352f;">If you encounter any issues with your subscription or the upgrade process, please contact </span><a href="https://support.apple.com/HT204084" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple Support</a><span style="color: #37352f;"> for further assistance.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #37352f;">Q: I’m trying to make a Discord purchase through my Apple device and it’s not working. What should I do?</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #37352f;">A: If you're experiencing issues while attempting to make a Discord purchase on your Apple device, we recommend trying to complete the purchase on the Desktop or Web client instead. If using a different device is not an option, the problem might be related to the Apple App Store. In this case, please contact </span><a href="https://support.apple.com/HT204084" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple Support</a><span style="color: #37352f;"> for further assistance.</span></p>
