<p id="docs-internal-guid-19fc1892-7fff-8091-9662-2453d7666148"><strong>Q: Who can currently access the Shop and buy and use profile effects?</strong></p>
<p>A:  The Shop is available to all Discord users. If you are also a Nitro member, you will have special member pricing on all purchases within the Shop!  </p>
<p><strong>Q: How do I get a discount on items in the Shop?</strong></p>
<p>A: Only Nitro members have access to special member pricing in the Shop. You can find more information about Nitro <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000435108-What-are-Nitro-Nitro-Basic-" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Q: I already have the avatar decoration which is part of a Shop Bundle. Why am I unable to purchase the Shop Bundle to obtain the profile effect? </strong></p>
<p>A: Shop Bundles allow you to buy two items from the same collection at a discounted price. These bundles are available only if you haven't purchased any of the items included. If you already own one or both items, the bundle will be marked as partially or fully owned, and you won't be able to purchase the remaining item(s) at a discount. In such cases, you'll need to buy the remaining item individually.</p>
<p id="docs-internal-guid-9c48c930-7fff-3935-9058-795b8d132156"><strong>Q: Is localized pricing available for Shop purchases?</strong></p>
<p>A: Localized pricing is available for Shop purchases in some countries. You should see localized pricing options in the Shop if you are eligible. You can learn more about localized pricing <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/4407269525911" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. </p>
<div class="info-box">
<strong>Note</strong>: Shop gifts are not available at localized prices. Depending on a user’s region, they may be able to pay for a gift in their local currency, but the price will still be equivalent to the USD price.</div>
<p><strong>Q: What is your refund policy for Shop purchases?</strong></p>
<p>A: You can find our full refund policy, including Shop purchases and Nitro subscriptions, <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012668071-Refund-Policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. </p>
<p id="docs-internal-guid-7f1a5203-7fff-0964-c4a2-4697b212b222"><strong>Q: I purchased a gift for a friend, but it wasn’t sent to them! Where can I find this missing gift?</strong></p>
<p>A: If you bought a gift from the Shop but it was not sent to your friend, you can go to <strong>User Settings &gt; Gift Inventory</strong> where you’ll find any purchased but unsent gifts. You can resend those gifts from the <strong>Gift Inventory</strong>!</p>
<p><strong>Q: What happens to my purchased items if my account is deleted?</strong></p>
<p>A: Your use of Discord is subject to our <a href="https://discord.com/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Terms of Service</a> and <a href="https://discord.com/guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Community Guidelines</a>, and access to any items purchased on Discord may be lost in the case of temporary or permanent account suspension or self-requested deletion. Additionally, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your account. </p>
<p id="docs-internal-guid-5bb8c24f-7fff-9a25-c5f5-2f21c75d8c35"><strong>Q: What if my friend sends me a gift from the Shop, but I already have the item in my collection? </strong></p>
<p>A: Don’t worry, your friend will not be able to send an item that has already been claimed and added to your collection. </p>
<p>However, if a gifted item has not been claimed and added to your collection, it is possible that you may receive the same gifted item again. If this is the case, you can choose to claim one of the gifts. Then, the other gifts with the same item will be returned to the sender within 48 hours, and they can choose to send the gift to someone else.</p>
