</ul>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: I was gifted a Nitro subscription previously, can I redeem this Nitro subscription to my Discord account?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: Nope! <span id="docs-internal-guid-33b82fe1-7fff-71ae-af60-6c44edda8114">Only users who haven’t had a Nitro subscription on their Discord accounts in the past 12 months are able to redeem this Nitro trial.</span> However, this promotion link can be gifted to a friend! </span></p>

<h2 id="h_01FWQ7JF2P6B5ZD4JEVHFNGDKF"><strong>PAYMENT INFO AND SUBSCRIPTION QUESTIONS</strong></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: Why do I need to submit my payment info to redeem Nitro?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: Because Nitro is a subscription plan, at the end of your free 3 month trial, we will start your first billing cycle so you can continue to enjoy Nitro on Discord.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, you can cancel the Nitro subscription at any time before the end of the three months!</span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: Why do I see a hold on my account when this is supposed to be a free promotion?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: Just to clarify, this Nitro promotion is free, however, there will be a</span><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4402712000663" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> temporary hold</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> placed on the payment method upon activating the promotion. This is to help Discord confirm the payment method works as expected and to prevent the use of fraudulent payment methods. This charge will appear in your Discord transaction history, and it may appear as a hold on your payment method.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We immediately reverse the temporary hold, and you’ll see that reflected in your Discord transaction history. Your bank may take longer to remove the hold from your payment method. Note: Banks will usually remove the temporary hold from your account within a few business days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your Discord transaction history does not show the hold released after 5 business days, please let us know at</span><a href="https://dis.gd/contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> https://dis.gd/contact</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and our support team will be able to investigate this issue further.</span></p>

<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: I see a "Sorry, looks like you’ve already had a Nitro sub" error when I try to apply my Nitro promotional link! </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you're seeing an “Sorry, looks like you’ve already had a Nitro sub” error, that means that you've previously subscribed to Nitro on your Discord account in the past 12 months and you won't be able to redeem this 3 month perk! However, this promotion link can be gifted to a friend! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have never subscribed to Nitro, please submit a ticket through our support system:</span><a href="https://dis.gd/contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> https://dis.gd/contact</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and our support team will be able to investigate further.

<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: I see a "This gift has already been redeemed" error when I try to apply my Nitro promotion link!</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: If you are seeing a "This gift has been redeemed already" error, that means that the Nitro promotion link has already been used and cannot be used again. You may need to double check if you've redeemed this promo on another Discord account.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular, if you redeemed this promotion using your mobile device, double check the browser on your mobile device and see which Discord account you are currently logged into. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, once the promotional link has been redeemed, the promo cannot be re-enabled, and the Nitro cannot be transferred from one account to another.</span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: I see a "Seems like something’s gone wrong" error when I try to apply my Nitro promo link! </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: If you're seeing an “Seems like something’s gone wrong” error, that means that the link is invalid! If you've copy and pasted this promotional link, we recommend you double check the link you were given once more and make sure it exactly matches the link from the <a href="https://www.samsung.com/uk/boost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung Boost page</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you received this promo link from a friend, double check with your friend on the exact link to make sure that it matches the link given! Please note that our support team is unable to intervene if your friend has given an invalid link and we will not be able to provide a new promotion link.</span></p>
