<h1 id="h_01F6TGK5YW806NEQV8JRAMFH05">Discord X GLSEN</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year we have partnered with <a href="https://www.glsen.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GLSEN</a> - an organization committed to impacting K-12 education on a national scale by affirming learning environments for LGBTQ+ youth. But as well as activating supportive educators, we believe in centering and uplifting student-led movements, which have powered initiatives like the Day of Silence, Ally Week, and more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This partnership is part of a longer-lasting commitment with the organization. We understand that social justice and a focus on diversity and inclusion should not end once the celebration stops. </span></p>
<p><strong>June is a great kickoff month, but supporting the community and LGBTQI+ initiatives should be a focus year-round.</strong></p>
<h2>So what's happening?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Join Discord for this year's Pride celebrations as we partner with GLSEN and spread some love in the form of super cute pins and stickers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that are already up and running on our </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;" href="https://tiltify.com/+discord-x-glsen-2021-pride-celebrations/stronger-together-discord-2021-pride-celebrations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tiltify page</a><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">! </span></p>
