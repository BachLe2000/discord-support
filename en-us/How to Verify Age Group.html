<h1 id="h_01JQ4N4R4K238K45JTARQVK2CN">Why do I need to verify my age group?</h1>
<p>Some Discord features or spaces are designed for certain age groups. We're experimenting with new ways to verify your age when you try to access them.</p>
<h1 id="h_01JQ4N5599MNJP93871HS6VY9S">How do I verify my age group?</h1>
<p>1. If you have not verified your age group and are included in the experiment, when you access an age-restricted space, you’ll see an <strong>age-restricted warning</strong>. If age verification is required, press the <strong>Verify Age</strong> button to begin.</p>

<h1 id="h_01JQ4N9Y8E96WFDRN01KC81VTP">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<p><strong>Q: Is my data stored when I use Face Scan or ID verification?</strong></p>
<p>A: The information you share to power the age verification method that you choose is only used for the one-time age verification process and is not stored by Discord or its vendor. For Face Scan, the solution our vendor uses operates on-device, which means there is no collection of any biometric information when you scan your face. For ID verification, the scan of your ID is deleted upon verification. </p>
<p><strong>Q: Do I need to verify my age multiple times to access age-restricted content?</strong></p>
<p>A: No. Age verification is a one-time process. Once your age group is confirmed, you won't need to verify again when you attempt to access an age-restricted feature. However, if you believe your age group is incorrect, you may retry the age verification process again.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What happens if my age group is verified incorrectly or it fails to verify.</strong></p>
<p>A: You have two options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Retry verification through your chat with Discord system messages where you can select <strong>Retry </strong>to enter the verification flow again.</li>
<li>You can retry by opting for a <strong>manual review </strong><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000029731" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a><strong>. </strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Q: How long does verification take?</strong></p>
<p>A: The verification process typically takes just a few minutes. You'll receive notifications about the status and a DM from Discord's official profile once completed.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What happens if I’m banned after age verification?</strong></p>
