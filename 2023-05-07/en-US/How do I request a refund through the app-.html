<h3>Note: <br>- This is an experiment at this time, and not everyone has access to this option in their app! Stay tuned for more details in the future though! <br>- Additionally, in-app refunds are not available on mobile at this time. </h3>
<p>We're experimenting with a way for people to be able to request refunds within the browser or desktop version of the Discord app as long as your purchase meets <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012668071" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our refund policy</a>. </p>
<h1>How do I request a refund through the app?</h1>
<p>1. If you are a part of the experiment, first log into your Discord account on the<a href="https://discord.com/login" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> browser</a> or desktop version of our app! </p>
<p> </p>
<p>2. Then make sure to completely <strong>refresh and restart</strong> your browser or desktop app!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>3. Once you have refreshed and restarted your app, then you can access <strong>in-app refunds</strong> in <strong>User Settings &gt; Billing. </strong></p>
<h3 class="wysiwyg-text-align-center">
<strong>NOTE: <br></strong>- If you have cancelled the subscription, try un-cancelling the subscription and then refresh your app to see if that helps!<br>- Additionally, if you're not seeing the refund button, try clicking on the arrow symbol in order to open the purchase details (as shown below)!<strong><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/4408303042967/Screen_Shot_2021-09-11_at_1.00.10_PM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2021-09-11_at_1.00.10_PM.png" width="652" height="145"></strong>
</h3>
<p>4. Below <strong>"<span class="notion-enable-hover" data-token-index="1" data-reactroot="">Issues with your purchase?</span>"</strong>, you will see a <strong>"<span class="notion-enable-hover" data-token-index="3" data-reactroot="">Refund</span>"</strong> button.</p>
<ul>
<li>✅ If a purchase is eligible for a refund, the <strong>"Refund"</strong> button will look like so:</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>⛔️ If a purchase is not eligible for a refund, the <strong>"Refund"</strong> button will be grayed out and you will see why we cannot refund that purchase:</li>
</ul>

<p>5. Once you click the <strong>"Refund"</strong> button, you will see a modal prompting you to <strong>"Select a reason for the refund"</strong> and text informing you of our refund policy.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/4408147339927/3.png" alt="3.png"></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">6. You will have to click on the dropdown menu and select a reason. Possible reasons include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bought a gift I didn’t use</li>
<li>Changed my mind</li>
<li>Bought it by mistake</li>
<li>Forgot to cancel</li>
<li>Had a problem using Boosts</li>
<li>Wasn’t what I expected</li>
<li>Want to switch Nitro plans</li>
<li>Don’t need it anymore</li>

</ul>

<p>7.  Lastly, press <strong>"<span class="notion-enable-hover" data-token-index="1" data-reactroot="">Submit</span>"</strong> to confirm your refund request</p>
<h2>How Do I Know if My Refund was Successful?</h2>
<p>If the refund is successfully processed, the modal will close, sending you back to the Billing tab and the purchase refunded will have a green tag that says <span class="wysiwyg-color-green120"><strong>"<span class="notion-enable-hover" data-token-index="1" data-reactroot="">REFUNDED</span>"</strong></span>.</p>

<h2>What if I see an Error? </h2>
<p>If there is an error and the refund is not successfully processed, a <strong>"Something went wrong"</strong> message will appear and you will need to <a href="https://dis.gd/billing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contact our support team</a> for further assistance.</p>
