<h3 id="h_01HEJRG4MR3HJMVH783CQCFZJW"><span style="color: #434343;">This feature is currently an experiment and limited to a few servers. </span></h3>
<p>Have you ever stepped away from your phone and came back to dozens of missed messages? Overwhelmed at trying to catch up on what everyone is talking about? We know it can be hard to quickly identify topics and find your conversations without having to scroll your way through endless messages. </p>
<p>To fix all of that, Discord is excited to introduce <strong>In-Channel Conversation Summaries. </strong>This feature helps keep you in the know and lets you jump back into the action in seconds. In-Channel Conversation Summaries consolidates the messages you receive into easy-to-navigate topics. These topics let you quickly see what others are chatting about, catch-up, and engage more immediately in important conversations. You’ll also be able to see a conversation preview, the number of messages about a specific topic, and who is part of the discussion.</p>

<p>Being able to quickly jump back into a conversation is that much easier, no matter how much you’ve missed. </p>
<h1 id="h_01HEJRG4MRT6EAE4NCQD084F1T">Where to find In-Channel Conversation Summaries</h1>
<p>In-Channel Conversation Summaries are currently available in select servers as part of a text channel’s subheader. You can see the different topics being discussed in the In-Channel Conversation Summaries subheader or dive deeper by opening up the subheader to show summarized snippets.</p>
<h2 id="h_01HEJRG4MR5EXESJPMXXQKHAGY">Topic Subheader</h2>
<p>In a text channel, you’ll see a subheader showing the currently viewed topic. Instead of having to read individual messages to figure out what’s going on, you can get a quick sense for what is being talked about. Small arrows help you go back and forth between previous topics.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/18859419487511" alt="image5.png"></p>
<h2 id="h_01HEJRG4MRPAE93CYH0Q59DVHA">Summaries List</h2>
<p>To skim through a list of conversations, select the currently shown topic in the subheader. This opens a panel where you can see a list of conversations, their associated topic, a short snippet, and some of the participants involved. Selecting any of these conversations navigates you to the beginning of that discussion.</p>
