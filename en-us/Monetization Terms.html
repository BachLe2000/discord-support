Offerings can include things like subscriptions to your server or content, access to certain perks or roles, one-time purchases, recurring subscriptions, and more.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span id="docs-internal-guid-3aef020f-7fff-32e6-6639-32792dd7d4ef" style="color: #4f545c;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Discord’s services include tools that make it easy to create and manage an Offering.

We can choose who is eligible to sell things through our services at our discretion. We may include additional requirements or details directly in the services where you create a particular Offering, so please review those parts of our services carefully before creating an offering.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must accurately and fully describe your Offering, including what the user gets, the full price, any disclaimers or limitations about the Offering, and any rules or requirements (such as who is eligible) or other conditions that apply to users who purchase your Offering. Once they have purchased your Offering, you must provide users with what you offered them. If you materially change an existing Offering (for example by taking away perks), you must offer users who purchased the Offering a refund, or in the case of subscription, inform them of the changes and give them an opportunity to cancel or modify their subscription before the changes take effect. If we determine that you have not provided or are unable to provide users with the Offering they purchased, we may refund those users on your behalf. <br></span></p>

If you are selling age-restricted offerings, you must clearly identify that your offering is age-restricted. You must also verify that those who help provide or appear in your Offerings (including age-restricted content) are the age of majority, and where applicable, you must store their consent to participate. Discord may remove your Offering (including any associated content), indefinitely block or withhold payment, and/or terminate your account or community for violations of our Terms. See the “Restrictions” section below for more details.</span></span></p>

You authorize Discord to determine a user’s eligibility for a refund under the Refund Policy in its sole discretion and to apply eligible refunds to a user’s account. You must provide a way for users who purchase your Offering to reach out to you to resolve disputes directly, and you (and not Discord) are responsible for resolving disputes that are not covered by the Refund Policy. Where you have been unable to resolve such a dispute and we determine that you have not provided or are unable to provide users with the Offering as described, we may provide a refund directly to users on your behalf. For any purchases made via mobile in-app purchases, you authorize the relevant mobile app store to determine refund eligibility and to issue eligible refunds directly to users.</span><br></span></p>

While we try to avoid disruptions, we cannot guarantee that there will not be an outage or change to the services, and your offering may not be accessible due to such outages or changes. To the extent permitted under applicable law, we are not liable for any such outages or service changes, including without limitation any incidental, special, indirect, or consequential damages, loss of profits, revenue, or data, or cost of cover.</span></span></p>

To be eligible to receive payouts, you’ll need to create an account with a third-party payout provider made available to you on Discord (“Payout Provider”). When you create an account with a Payout Provider, you may be entering into a direct relationship with that Payout Provider. If you will be entering into a direct relationship with the Payout Provider, we will present their applicable terms to you. Please review those terms closely. You will not be eligible to receive a payout until our Payout Provider has provisioned your account. Eligible payouts will be provided within forty five (45) days after the end of each calendar month. For example, for Offerings purchased in January, you will receive payouts within 45 days after January 31st. All payouts will be made via the payment method that you link through our Payout Provider. You can choose any payout currency offered by a Payout Provider, but the Payout Provider may charge a conversion fee. You must have a minimum balance of $100.00 to be eligible to receive your first payout, and a minimum balance of $25 for any subsequent payouts that you are eligible to receive. You can see payout status and other information in your Discord Server Settings by going to Payments under Premium Memberships. </span></span></p>

We or our Payout Providers may also block or hold payouts for violations of our Terms (see “Restrictions” section below), for compliance reasons, including collecting tax reporting information, or if we anticipate a high volume of refunds or chargebacks on your Offerings. When payouts are delayed or blocked we try to communicate the reason to you promptly.
