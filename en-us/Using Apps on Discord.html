<h1 id="docs-internal-guid-9d109a73-7fff-beff-25ba-562d8ae90670">What Are Apps?</h1>
<p id="docs-internal-guid-f29fc1e7-7fff-20d6-4d6e-4c0654f2c5f2">Discord<strong> Apps</strong> add functionality, entertainment, and productivity tools to your servers, direct messages (<strong>DMs</strong>), group chats, and voice calls. These apps can range from bots that automate tasks, to activities that allow you to play games, collaborate on projects, or share experiences with others directly within Discord. </p>
<p id="docs-internal-guid-1535fe26-7fff-4baf-b0cb-a3bdffa72cf6">Apps are created by Discord, third parties, or by Discord users and can vary from games to moderation to everything else in between. If you’re an app developer and would like to learn more about apps on Discord, you can check out our <a href="https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Developer Support Help Center</a>.</p>
<p id="docs-internal-guid-94c396ed-7fff-9265-8f6d-a921495c2574"><strong>Types of Discord Apps:</strong></p>
<p>1. <strong>Bots</strong>: Automated programs that can perform a variety of tasks such as moderating chats, providing user support, playing music, or organizing games. They typically exist within a server and appear as a member of the server.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Activities</strong>: Interactive experiences like games, quizzes, or collaborative tools such as whiteboards that you can enjoy with others in real-time in text chats or voice calls. Learn more about activities in our <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4422142836759-Activities-on-Discord" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Activities on Discord Help Center</a> article.</p>

<h1 id="h_01HRQSA6C8TRHS722P1H3HW1TV">How to Use Apps</h1>
<p>You can interact with an app in a multitude of ways. If you have an app installed, you can use one of its commands by using slash commands, or by right-clicking on a user or message and selecting <strong>Apps</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="docs-internal-guid-817a9772-7fff-78a7-726d-2bd5151af070">Launching Apps with the Shapes Button</h2>
<h3 id="h_01HV2F1EHPX7EW6HVN9W10GGKD">The Shapes button is currently only available in servers on mobile.</h3>

<p id="docs-internal-guid-bf71f92c-7fff-302f-1ae7-79f8383cf865">The easiest way to launch an app is by selecting the <strong>Shapes</strong> button in the chat bar and selecting the app you would like to start. </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/22691351902487" width="247" height="505">   <img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/22691366507159" width="244" height="500"></p>
<p>It then provides an interface for selecting preset commands for the app without having to type <span id="docs-internal-guid-78ef56ef-7fff-59ed-dad9-d752548e54be">them out.</span></p>

</h3>
<h1 id="h_01HRQSA6C89EVW06TR83E76S86">How to Discover Apps</h1>
<p>Discord’s <strong>App Directory</strong> lets you search, browse, and explore various <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/19265818186135" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">apps</a> you can add to customize your server. </p>
<h3 id="h_01HRQSA6C8TSTZK0FKE7YA6Y86"><span style="color: #434343;">Note: The App Directory is only available on desktop and browser. </span></h3>
<p>To find various apps available on Discord, you can head over to the <strong>App Directory.</strong></p>
<p>1. Head over to your server and left-click the <strong>server name</strong> located in the upper-left corner. </p>
<p>2. Then, select <strong>Server Settings &gt; App Directory</strong>. </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/22010331730071" width="600" height="340"></p>

<h1 id="h_01HRQSA6C8JS7635V92XMF70RS">How to Add Apps</h1>
<p>Once you’ve had a chance to explore the <strong>App Directory</strong> and browse the various categories, you may find an app you would like to add.</p>
<p>Most apps can be added to a server where you have the <strong>Manage Server</strong> permission, or where you’re the owner of the server. </p>
<p>Alternatively, some apps can be added directly to your account. Apps that can be added to your account will ask if you want to add the app to your account instead of to a server.</p>
<h2 id="h_01HRQSA6C8KM019KXN99DESNGC">Within the App Directory</h2>
<p>1. If you meet the permission requirements, head over to the <strong>App Directory</strong> and select an app you would like to add. While in the app’s page, you can read the <strong>Overview</strong> to learn more about the app and its functionality. </p>
<p>2. Then, press<strong> Add App </strong>and follow the prompts to confirm you would like to add the app. Some apps may ask if you want to add the app to your account or server, you can choose where to add the app here.</p>

<h1 id="h_01HRQSA6C8H2XBF34NSSQH7ZFH">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<p><strong>Q: Who should I reach out to if I am experiencing issues with the app?</strong></p>
<p>A: Discord does not create or maintain apps, app developers do themselves. </p>
<p>If you are experiencing issues with the app, please reach out to the app’s support team by heading over to their app’s support server. Most support servers can be found within the app’s <strong>Overview</strong> section within the <strong>App Directory</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Q: Who is able to manage apps in a server?</strong></p>
<p>A: To manage apps in a server, you must be the owner of the server or have the <strong>Manage Server </strong>permissions enabled. </p>
<p><strong>Q: I no longer want the app in my server. How do I remove the app? </strong></p>
<p>A: To remove the app, right-click the app’s bot within the <strong>Members list</strong> and <strong>kick</strong> the bot. By kicking the bot from the server, the app will be removed. </p>
<p><strong>Q: Where can I use Apps?</strong></p>
<p>A: <span id="docs-internal-guid-2580c40c-7fff-dbfd-6cde-4a9d79bdf6a2">Apps that are added directly to a server can be used within that server if the server’s permissions are set up to allow members to use that app. Apps that are added directly to a user’s account can be used in any server that the user is in.</span></p>
<p><strong>Q: How do I install an app to my account?</strong></p>
<p>A: Some apps can be installed to your account directly, instead of a server. Some developers will be updating their apps to enable this functionality. If you see an app that has this feature enabled, feel free to add the app to your account! Please note that apps that are added to your account may not have all the same capabilities as apps added to a server. </p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-c39d8fa9-7fff-bec8-aff4-b6e0f6352beb">Note: installing apps to your account is currently in a rollout phase. In servers with more than 200 members, only you will be able to see the app’s response to your application command.</span></p>
<p><strong>Q: My server utilizes AutoMod. Will messages from application commands be affected or flagged by AutoMod?</strong></p>
<p>A: AutoMod will not flag messages from apps that you’ve installed onto your server.</p>
<p>AutoMod will only flag messages from apps that are installed directly onto a user’s account. Any actions taken by AutoMod will happen on the user who installed the application and first used it in a server. This means if an application creates a message with buttons, additional messages created from interacting with those buttons will also action against the user who used the command initially.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Do user installed apps have access to data about my server or DM, or the people in it?</strong></p>
<p>A: No, these apps installed to your account are not able to access information about your server or DMs. They also do not have permissions to take action in your server or DMs, other than responding to your interactions. Additionally,  user installed apps are not able to get information about members of your servers or DMs that have not used the app. If a user does choose to interact with the app (e.g., through buttons and select menus), then the app can access their basic user information, like their username and <a href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/guild#guild-member-object" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">guild member information</a> (if in a server). </p>
<p>Please refer to the app’s developer or its privacy policy to learn more about its data practices. You can also learn more about data access by apps installed in servers generally <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/7933951485975-Visibility-of-Bot-Data-Access" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
