<h1 id="h_01HP046TF46Y6VSBP1V4E18JYC">Text Channels</h1>
<p><strong>Text channels</strong>, distinguished by the <strong>#</strong> symbol (also known as the pound sign, hashtag, or octothorpe) in the channel list of a server, are where text communications can take place.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color=""><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/21170418255383" width="624" height="465"></span></p>
<p>When you want to utilize text channels, here are a few things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Selecting a channel in the left-hand panel will highlight it and bring the channel's content to the main view of the Discord app.</li>
<li>Pressing on the <strong>cogwheel</strong> next to the text channel's name is how you can edit a channel, if you have the permissions to do so. You may also see the <strong>Invite People</strong> icon which looks like a symbol of a person with a plus sign next to the channel name. This will allow you to send an invite to the channel.</li>
<li>Enter your message in the text box at the bottom of the client and press the <strong>Enter</strong> key to send the message to the text channel.</li>
<li>You can also send GIFs, stickers, emojis, and gifts through the text box.</li>
<li>You can interact with already-sent messages in the text channel by adding a <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/12102061808663" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reaction</a>, creating a <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403205878423-Threads-FAQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thread</a>, replying directly to a message, and more, depending on the permissions allowed to you or the role(s) you have in the server.</li>

<h1 id="h_01HP046TF4JWJD3TWYVR5S174Y">Text Chat in Voice Channels</h1>
<p>Using the embedded text chat in <strong>voice channels</strong>, users can send message content, comment on something being said without interrupting the speaker, and share links, memes, and more, all in the dedicated text chat within the voice channel. This feature allows users to chat without having to switch to a different text channel while in a voice channel, missing the stream you’re actively watching, or potentially distracting you from the live conversation happening in the voice channel.</p>
<h2 id="h_01HP046TF4HGR9R7F480KVTZQJ">Desktop/Browser</h2>
<p>There are 2 ways to access the text chat in a voice channel, let’s go over both for desktop and browser.</p>
<p><strong>Option 1</strong></p>
<p>1. Select on the <strong>Open Chat</strong> bubble to the right of the voice channel name.</p>
<p>2. This will automatically pull up the text chat for this voice channel on the right side.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/21170474008087" width="582" height="327"></p>
<p><strong>Option 2</strong></p>
<p>1. Press the voice channel to fully open it.</p>
<p>2. Next, tap on the <strong>Open Chat</strong> bubble in the top right corner and this will open the text chat.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/21170418301463" width="588" height="330"></p>
<h2 id="h_01HP046TF4KAT0V0JP631J1A2B">Mobile</h2>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/21170474029207" width="364" height="786"></p>
<h2 id="h_01HP046TF475HBXDTV9CKA13A7">Message Previews And Notifications</h2>
<p>If you are in a voice channel, but the text chat within that voice channel is closed, you can see <strong>message previews</strong> in the upper right-hand corner of the voice channel. Message previews will show new messages as they are sent and will disappear after some time or if other messages appear (three messages at the most and truncated after a certain number of characters).</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/21170474036119" width="624" height="351"></p>
<p>Message previews keep you in the loop of the active message conversation happening in the voice channel without needing to open the chat itself. However, if you want to turn these previews off for whatever reason simply press the three dots icon above and uncheck <strong>Show New Message Previews</strong>.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/21170474045719" width="321" height="124"></p>
<p>As for other indicators of new messages while in the voice channel - unread mentions will have a red number indicator, while unread messages will simply be indicated with a gray number indicator. Mentions within a text chat will also appear in your inbox, which can be accessed in the upper right corner of the client.</p>
