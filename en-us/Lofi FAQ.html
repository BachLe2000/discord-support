<h1 id="h_01J7KGNMD2BX7FGF86Z0HJH16S">How to Customize Lofi</h1>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">1. To change the sound effects and their volumes, look for suggested soundscapes by tapping on the white circles around the scene to increase or decrease the volume of an individual soundscape. Otherwise, tap the slider icon in the media controls for a list of soundscapes to adjust. Changing the soundscapes and their volume will change it for all users in the same Lofi Activity.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcFK1f794LjxFuJqYNBfjQq4PoZwffGvEKhsf8mtTs8roBKUk5BpI9Xtv32Xmxs2CwrSKIXfRr5G3KtxQO_oUsPKFxXW6gV2EuwwvveWnYNlTKJNDbhjwHO5n2BPfqOC1k6KJ9z3eCq9hPlNEoNqh-1oN_0?key=xTQCI6eaTnIzJThPzaHwdQ" width="624" height="352"></p>
<p>2. To adjust the activity volume itself, use the global volume slider in the lower right corner. This will only impact the volume for the person adjusting their volume and not all other listeners in the same Activity.</p>
<p>3. Users can select different scenes using the <strong>Scenes</strong> button in the UI Menu. Use the left and right buttons to scroll through the options. Changing a scene will change it for all users in the same Lofi Activity.</p>

<p>4. Users can start, pause, or go to the next music track using the media controls at the bottom of the screen. View local time and date by tapping on the clock in the bottom-left corner. If the scene allows, scenes can adjust from day to night using the toggle also in the bottom-left corner. Changing, pausing, and starting the music track will do the same for all players in the same Lofi Activity.</p>
