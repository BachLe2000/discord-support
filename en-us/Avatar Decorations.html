<p id="docs-internal-guid-43737dc2-7fff-6d6f-dff3-b8e118678317"><strong>Q: Who can currently access the Shop and buy and use avatar decorations?</strong></p>
<p>A: The Shop is available to all Discord users. If you are also a Nitro member, you will have special member pricing on all purchases within the Shop!</p>
<p id="docs-internal-guid-22992952-7fff-a0a6-ea7e-1cb0798d6051"><strong>Q: How do I get a discount on avatar decorations in the Shop?</strong></p>
<p>A: Only Nitro members have access to special member pricing in the Shop. You can find more information about Nitro <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/115000435108-Discord-Nitro-Classic-Nitro">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Do I keep the avatar decorations I’ve purchased? </strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, any decorations you’ve purchased are yours to keep and use anytime, even without an active Nitro subscription. </p>
<p id="docs-internal-guid-f7040b83-7fff-636f-0da6-d9be924c756a"><strong>Q: Do I get to keep the DISXCORE decorations I’ve collected?</strong></p>
<p>A: The Nitro exclusive DISXCORE decorations can be collected by Nitro members, but require an active Nitro subscription to use. If you decide to cancel your Nitro subscription, the decorations will remain in your collection but you won’t be able to use them. </p>
<p><strong>Q: I thought avatar decorations used to be free for Nitro members. Why do I have to buy them now?</strong></p>
<p>A: Previously, avatar decorations would only be freely available for Nitro members to use for a limited time and then they would disappear, which would leave a lot of folks sad. A lot of you also told us our decorations needed more variety.</p>
<p>Now avatar decorations are designed to be yours to keep and use anytime when you buy them. We’ve also been working hard to make avatar decorations better than before, with even more charming and fun designs, higher quality animations and effects, and more styles to choose from.<br>As a friendly reminder, if you’re a Nitro member, you can collect the <strong>3 bonus DISXCORE</strong> avatar decorations from the Shop!</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I refund an avatar decoration I’ve purchased?</strong></p>
<p>A: No, avatar decorations are non-refundable. You can learn more about our Refund Policy <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012668071-Refund-Policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I refund Nitro after buying an avatar decoration?</strong></p>
<p>A: No. If you’ve purchased an avatar decoration within <strong>5 days </strong>of your Nitro subscription renewing or becoming a new Nitro member, you will not be eligible to refund that Nitro subscription.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How often do you add new decorations? </strong></p>
<p>A: We don’t have specific details related to when new decorations become available, but our team is hard at work to make sure we continue to bring new and fun styles to your hands.</p>
