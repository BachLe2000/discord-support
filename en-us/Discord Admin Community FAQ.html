<p><strong>Welcome! We're excited to tell you more about the Discord Admins server, a server for community builders and leaders.</strong></p>

<h1><strong>WHAT IS THE DISCORD ADMINS SERVER?</strong></h1>
<p>This server allows Discord to chat with admins, moderators, content creators, and server owners who manage a server with Community Settings on. </p>
<p>Here you can learn more about features, use best practices, and meet other members who want to improve their communities!</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large wysiwyg-color-blue90"><strong>What can I find in the Discord Admins server?<br></strong></span></p>
<p>The Discord Admins server primarily focuses on engaging, managing, protecting, and growing thriving communities on Discord. </p>
<p>Here you can find chatter about best practices, safety, apps, monetization, and more. Members will also receive updates on new features or updates directly from Discord.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large wysiwyg-color-blue90"><strong>Where can I find the rules for the server?</strong></span></span></p>
<p>Current rules can be found in the #rules channel. Be sure to read them completely!</p>
<p>However, Discord reserves the right to act on misbehavior and violations not explicitly listed in our rules. At all times, use common sense and good judgment for anything you do on the server. Moderation actions by Staff or Moderators will ensure that we continue to promote healthy communities and assume that all Admins will be acting with positive intent.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large wysiwyg-color-blue90"><strong>I'm in the server, but I can't see any channels! What should I do?</strong></span></span></p>
<p>Confirm you’ve agreed to the rules in #rules and completed Community Onboarding in the server. </p>
<p>If you still struggle to see the server, please contact the Community Programs Support team<a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000168511" target="_self" rel="undefined"> here</a>.</p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">SUSPICIOUS THINGS TO LOOK OUT FOR</span></h2>
<p><strong>Someone invited me to an admin server. How do I know it’s the real deal?</strong></p>
<p>The Discord Admins server is a Verified Server. Be cautious of any server posing to be this server.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/6823987696791/Screen_Shot_2022-06-16_at_7.55.48_AM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2022-06-16_at_7.55.48_AM.png" width="252" height="47"></p>
<p><strong>I received a DM related to the Discord Admins server. How do I know if it’s legitimate?</strong></p>
<p>If you receive a DM mentioning the Discord Admins server, an invite to the Discord Admins server, or any type of “sign up” message, do not click on any link or file in the message. </p>
<p>Unless the message is an automated system message with the verified “System” label and checkmark (see image below), the message is not from Discord and should be reported to Trust and Safety as Spam.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/6824013898519/Screen_Shot_2022-06-16_at_7.55.59_AM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2022-06-16_at_7.55.59_AM.png" width="260" height="49"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember, Discord staff will <strong>never</strong> ask for any of your account information or redirect you to outside third-party sites. Always be cautious when receiving any messages posing as official Discord communication that seem strange. You can learn more about reporting this behavior to Discord <a href="https://discord.com/safety/360044103651-reporting-abusive-behavior-to-discord" target="_self">here</a>.</span></p>
