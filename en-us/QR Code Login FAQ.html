<p>With QR code login, you can connect to Discord quickly and securely without typing out your full password or sharing your password on an unfamiliar setup! Scanning a QR code with your logged-in account on your Discord mobile app is a super easy way to get logged in on a new computer, no matter where you are.</p>

<h3 id="h_01HVKHQP8S3GQBQ2FG63C1WQ0Z"><span style="color: #434343; --darkreader-inline-color: #beb8b0;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">You can scan the QR code using any application that supports QR scanning, including the Camera app on many devices. You'll get a quick shortcut to the Discord app for final scanning and approval.</span></h3>
<p>To log in using a QR code, you'll first want to download the Discord mobile app and log in with your account credentials. Once you're logged in on your mobile device, you can log into the Discord desktop or browser client by scanning a QR code within the app. Here are the full steps on how to do this:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1. Tap on your user profile image in the Discord mobile app located in the bottom right corner.</p>
<p>2. Next, tap on the <strong>cogwheel</strong> [<img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/22839154423063" width="23" height="24">] to enter your <strong>User Settings</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Scroll down until you see <strong>Scan QR Code</strong> under <strong>Account Settings</strong>.</p>

<p>4. This will then open up your camera app and you just have to scan the QR code shown in either the Discord app or the browser. QR codes are only available for 2 minutes, so if yours expires, you’ll have to refresh to get a new one!</p>
<p>5. Next on your mobile device you’ll get the option to approve by tapping on <strong>Log in</strong> or you can tap <strong>Cancel</strong> to cancel it.</p>

<p>6. Now you should be logged in on the desktop app or browser!</p>
<p>After approval, your desktop device will be logged in and ready to go! Want to log out of that device? Just head to <strong>User Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Log Out</strong> on the desktop or browser client and you'll be logged out until your next session.</p>

<span style="color: #434343;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">If someone you don't know is asking you to login using a QR code, they may be trying to phish your account.

<p>You have full control over what devices are allowed for login with the verification screen shown above. Even if you've scanned a QR code that has opened the Discord app by mistake, you can prevent the login attempt right away.</p>
<p>Never approve a QR code login that you didn't generate yourself! If you've been sent a QR code by someone else that opened the login verification screen, hit <strong>Cancel</strong> right away.</p>
<p>If you approve a login that wasn't yours by mistake, you can <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/218410947" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">change your Discord password</a> to log out all devices at once, including those you don't personally approve of.</p>
<p>Most importantly, don't forget that any QR code login attempt needs to be approved before it goes through. Keep an eye out for that verification screen and never verify or approve a login that you didn't prompt.</p>
