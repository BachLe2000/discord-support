<h1 id="h_01JBHZ94DY89MQG9D2FDSA74Y5">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<p><strong>Q: Why don't I see this offer in my Discord app?</strong></p>
<p>A: If you don't see any promotion details on your <strong>Nitro</strong> tab across the desktop, browser, or mobile apps, it is because you do not meet the eligibility criteria.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What happens if I have an active Server Boosting subscription?</strong></p>
<p>A: If a user has had a Server Boosting membership active on their account and they have not had a Nitro membership within the last 30 days, redeeming this promotion will replace your original Server Boosting membership with a Nitro membership. You can learn more about Nitro <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000435108-What-are-Nitro-Nitro-Basic-" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. </p>
<div class="info-box">
<strong>Please note</strong>: if you don’t see the trial on your mobile device, head over to the Nitro page on desktop to check for availability. </div>
<p><strong>Q: Why do I need to submit my payment info to redeem Nitro?</strong></p>
<p>A: Because Nitro is a membership, at the end of your 2-week trial, we will start your first billing cycle so you can continue to enjoy Nitro.</p>
<p>However, you can <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/115000435108-What-are-Nitro-Nitro-Basic-#h_01GFV3PNMEJEF92W0XX69MEE2W" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cancel Nitro</a> at any time, including during trial. To cancel Nitro on desktop, head to your <strong>User Settings </strong>&gt; select <strong>Subscriptions</strong> &gt; press <strong>Cancel </strong>within the Nitro banner. These steps may appear slightly different on mobile.  </p>
<div class="info-box">
<strong>Please note</strong>: You will not be charged until the trial ends and the membership renews. We’ll send an email before the paid membership begins, and you’ll have the opportunity to cancel before you are charged by following the steps <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/19580873036695-How-to-Cancel-your-Nitro-Subscription" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</div>
<p><strong>Q: Why do I see a temporary hold/charge on my account when this is supposed to be a trial?</strong></p>
<p>A: There is no charge for this 2-week Nitro trial. However, there will be a <strong>temporary hold</strong> placed on the payment method upon activating the promotion. This is to help Discord confirm that the submitted payment method is valid. This charge will appear in your Discord transaction history, and it may appear as a hold on your payment method.</p>
<p>After you redeem the trial offer, we reverse the temporary hold to return the funds, and you’ll see that reflected in your Discord transaction history. Your bank may take longer to remove the hold from your payment method.</p>
<div class="info-box">
<strong>Please note</strong>: Banks will usually remove the temporary hold from your account within a few business days.</div>
<p>If your Discord transaction history does not show the hold released after 5 business days, please let us know at<a href="https://dis.gd/contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> https://dis.gd/contact</a>, and our support team will be able to investigate this issue further.</p>
