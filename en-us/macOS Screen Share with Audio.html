<p>If you’re running an older OS than macOS 13+, you’ll see this option for screen share audio instead of just having it automatically enabled. Here’s how to manually enable it:</p>
<p>1. To get started, head over to your <strong>Voice &amp; Video</strong> settings (within the <strong>User Settings</strong>) and find the <strong>Screen Share</strong> section.</p>

<p>2. After pressing <strong>Install</strong>, you'll need to authorize ACE - the software written by Rogue Amoeba we use for capturing audio. This bit will look a little different depending on your macOS version:</p>

<li>macOS 10.15</li>
<li>macOS 11</li>
<li>Apple Silicon/ M-Series</li>
</ul>
