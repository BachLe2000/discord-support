<h1 id="h_01JQCZMA41QN07SG1PTNXRGSZ2"><strong>What is the Meaning of "Action Required" for My Purchase?</strong></h1>
<p>When making a Discord purchase, we may ask you to authorize your payment. This helps us confirm that the purchases are made by you, and to prevent any fraudulent activity.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/9615606121751" alt="cspa_1.png" width="627" height="496"></p>
<h1 id="h_01JQCZMA41QMHKGKQS5PTK1G64"><strong>How Do I Authorize My Payments?</strong></h1>
<p>You’ll see an in-app message appear when attempting to complete the purchase that will look like this:</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color=""><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/30974797068823" width="624" height="125"></span></p>
<p>You should then receive an email from Discord with the subject “<em>Authorize Payments for Discord Client</em>” to the email address associated with the Discord account you’re using to make this purchase.</p>
<p>When you open the email, you’ll see a message like this:</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color=""><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/30974797070999" alt="cspa_0a.png" width="624" height="596"></span></p>
<p>If you recognize the purchase on your account, go ahead and tap on the <strong>Verify Purchase</strong> button. You’ll be redirected to a new Discord landing page letting you know that your payment has been authorized.</p>
<p>Once your payment has been authorized, you can go back to the app and <strong>attempt to make the purchase again</strong>.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="color: #2e3338;" data-darkreader-inline-color=""><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/30974797071383" alt="cspa_2.png" width="623" height="444"></span></p>
<h1 id="h_01JQCZMA41Q0Q1Z7GCWN7V9EK0"><strong>What if I Didn't Make These Purchase Attempts?</strong></h1>
<p>If you didn't attempt to make these purchases, do not click the Verify Purchase button in the email. This might be a sign that your Discord account has been compromised or hacked.</p>
