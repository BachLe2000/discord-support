<h1 id="h_01HAD8XEZPCZ38NAG9NJAYCEQA">What is the Members page?</h1>
<p>The <strong>Members</strong> page provides moderators and admins with a dashboard view of new and existing server members within your server.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HFSV8TK0B6KHDQ2KYA4X12SM">For Community servers, select <strong>Members</strong> located in the channel list near the top left corner of the server to navigate to the Members page. For friend servers, this feature will be in <strong>Server Settings &gt; Members</strong>.</h3>
<p>From this page, you can see the following information regarding your server members:</p>
<ul>
<li>When they joined the server</li>
<li>The age of their Discord account</li>
<li>How they joined the server</li>
<li>Their current server roles</li>
<li>Messages sent in the server</li>
<li>Whether the user has agreed to the server’s rules</li>
<li>Signals that provide relevant safety information on users, such as who may be engaging in unusual direct message (<strong>DM</strong>) activity or are timed out</li>
<li>Whether they have <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/216679607--Verification-Levels" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">verified their Discord account based on the server’s settings</a>
</li>
<li>The total amount of messages and message history a server member has sent within your server</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="h_01HAD8XEZP095H4QXP1QAA600P">How does the Members page work?</h1>
<h3 id="h_01HAD8XEZPDDZZM8H2GXR3X4SF"><span style="color: #434343;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">To utilize the Members page, you will need to be the owner of that server or have the following permissions for that server: administrator, manage server, manage roles, manage nicknames, ban members, timeout members, or kick members. </span></h3>
<p>If you meet either requirements, then you can head into the server of your choice and select the <strong>Members </strong>tab above the server’s channel list. This will load a page where you can view all server members within that specific server.</p>
