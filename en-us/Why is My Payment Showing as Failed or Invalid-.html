<p>There are several reasons that can cause a payment to fail. To figure out what’s going on, we recommend following the steps below:</p>
<p>1. Ensure that the billing address associated with the card being charged is current and matches the information filed with your bank. You can learn how to manage your billing information <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017693772-Payments-and-Billing-FAQ"><span class="wysiwyg-underline" style="color: #1155cc;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">here</span></a>.</p>
<p>2. Ensure your card details are entered correctly.</p>
<p>3. Ensure the card hasn’t expired.</p>
<p>4. Depending on the card, ensure there are sufficient funds in the account or that the credit limit hasn’t been exceeded.</p>
<p>5. It’s possible a pre-set spending limit on the card was reached. Double-check if a spending limit has been set.</p>
