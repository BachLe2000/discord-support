<p id="docs-internal-guid-bed8c58a-7fff-f624-1447-58d62b5a6a27">Apps are created by Discord users and can vary from games to moderation to everything else in between. If you’re an app developer and would like to learn more about apps on Discord, you can check out our <a href="https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Developer Support Help Center</a>.</p>

<h1 id="h_01HRQSA6C8TRHS722P1H3HW1TV">How to Use Apps</h1>
<p>You can interact with an app in a multitude of ways. If you have an app installed, you can use one of its commands by using slash commands, or by right-clicking on a user or message and selecting <strong>Apps</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="h_01HRQSA6C85Z6CA9CF10DPRX1Q">Slash Commands</h2>
<p>To use an app’s slash commands, simply type <strong><span style="color: #188038;">”</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #188038;">/”</span></strong> in chat to bring up the <strong>command picker </strong>and select the command you would like to use. You can also type the entire<strong> “/ (command)”</strong> within the text box to initiate the command.</p>

<p>You can also interact with an app by right-clicking on a user or message and bringing up the dropdown menu. Additional interactions can be found under the <strong>Apps</strong> sub-menu.</p>

<p>Discord’s <strong>App Directory</strong> lets you search, browse, and explore various <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/19265818186135" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">apps</a> you can add to customize your server. </p>
<h3 id="h_01HRQSA6C8TSTZK0FKE7YA6Y86"><span style="color: #434343;">Note: The App Directory is only available on desktop and browser. </span></h3>
<p>To find various apps available on Discord, you can head over to the <strong>App Directory.</strong></p>

<h1 id="h_01HRQSA6C8JS7635V92XMF70RS">How to Add Apps</h1>
<p>Once you’ve had a chance to explore the <strong>App Directory</strong> and browse the various categories, you may find an app you would like to add.</p>
<p>Most apps can be added to a server where you have the <strong>Manage Server</strong> permission, or where you’re the owner of the server. </p>
<p>Alternatively, some apps can be added directly to your account. Apps that can be added to your account will ask if you want to add the app to your account instead of to a server.</p>
<h2 id="h_01HRQSA6C8KM019KXN99DESNGC">Within the App Directory</h2>
<p>1. If you meet the permission requirements, head over to the <strong>App Directory</strong> and select an app you would like to add. While in the app’s page, you can read the <strong>Overview</strong> to learn more about the app and its functionality. </p>
<p>2. Then, press<strong> Add App </strong>and follow the prompts to confirm you would like to add the app. Some apps may ask if you want to add the app to your account or server, you can choose where to add the app here.</p>

<p>If you added the app to your server, it will appear in your server’s <strong>Member List </strong>and in your <strong>Server Settings &gt; Integrations &gt; Bots and Apps</strong>. If you added the app to your account, you will see it under your settings, under <strong>Authorized Apps</strong>.</p>

<h1 id="h_01HRQSA6C8H2XBF34NSSQH7ZFH">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<p><strong>Q: Who should I reach out to if I am experiencing issues with the app?</strong></p>
<p>A: Discord does not create or maintain apps, app developers do themselves. </p>
<p>If you are experiencing issues with the app, please reach out to the app’s support team by heading over to their app’s support server. Most support servers can be found within the app’s <strong>Overview</strong> section within the <strong>App Directory</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Q: Who is able to manage apps in a server?</strong></p>
<p>A: To manage apps in a server, you must be the owner of the server or have the <strong>Manage Server </strong>permissions enabled. </p>
<p><strong>Q: I no longer want the app in my server. How do I remove the app? </strong></p>
<p>A: To remove the app, right-click the app’s bot within the <strong>Members list</strong> and <strong>kick</strong> the bot. By kicking the bot from the server, the app will be removed. </p>
<p><strong>Q: Where can I use Apps?</strong></p>
<p>A: Currently, most apps are only available for use in servers if someone with permissions has added them for members to use. We want it to be easier for users to access apps, so we're experimenting with a way for users to add apps to their own account to use in spaces they're in across Discord.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How do I install an app to my account?</strong></p>
<p>A: Some apps can be installed to your account directly, instead of a server. Some developers will be updating their apps to enable this functionality. If you see an app that has this feature enabled, feel free to add the app to your account! Please note that apps that are added to your account may not have all the same capabilities as apps added to a server. During this testing phase, an app’s response may also only be visible to you in larger servers.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Do user installed apps have access to data about my server or DM, or the people in it?</strong></p>
<p>A: No, these apps installed to your account are not able to access information about your server or DMs. They also do not have permissions to take action in your server or DMs, other than responding to your interactions. Additionally,  user installed apps are not able to get information about members of your servers or DMs that have not used the app. If a user does choose to interact with the app (e.g., through buttons and select menus), then the app can access their basic user information, like their username and <a href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/guild#guild-member-object" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">guild member information</a> (if in a server). </p>
<p>Please refer to the app’s developer or its privacy policy to learn more about its data practices. You can also learn more about data access by apps installed in servers generally <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/7933951485975-Visibility-of-Bot-Data-Access" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
