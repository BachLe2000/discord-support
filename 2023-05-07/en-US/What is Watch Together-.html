<h1 id="h_01GXVMPDF80MMJDQ0S0P5M2YZR">What Does It Mean To Be Hosting Or Sharing?</h1>
<p><span style="color: #2e3338;">By default, the person who started Watch Together is Hosting, and they control what’s playing. In hosting mode, anyone can add videos to the playlist, but only the host can pause, scrub, skip, reorder, and delete any video.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #2e3338;">If the host wants others to be able to control the video, they can toggle to Sharing mode. When sharing, all participants have controls over the playlist and the current video, and their actions apply to every user in the session. We recommend Hosting when in big groups and Sharing when in small groups!</span></p>
<h1 id="h_01GXVMPJENG36ZBV4J3Y7MFB2W">If I Change The Volume, Does It Change Everyone Else's Volume?</h1>
<p><span style="color: #2e3338;">Volume changes are always local, so if any user adjusts the volume or mutes the YouTube player, only their own audio is affected. </span></p>
<h1 id="h_01GXVMPSYXNESB6QG1FEYQ7KXA">Watching Multiple Livestream Channels</h1>
<p><span style="color: #2e3338;">Coachella will be streaming 6 channels on YouTube. If you want to jump between streams, you can add them all to your playlist. The host can click within the playlist to change the stream that the group is watching. To find all of the official Coachella YouTube livestream channels, search for </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIjqRbAQP0WKnG86NVOlJ-Kz5Qqbc7egY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this playlist</a><span style="color: #2e3338;"> in Watch Together. To add them to your playlist, press the +. Participants in the session can continue adding videos to the playlist throughout the Watch Together session.</span></p>
<h1 id="h_01GXVMQ19Z4RJMEPVVZK6FG8YR">Playback Time Limits</h1>
<p><span style="color: #2e3338;">Playback of videos is limited to 180 minutes if watching with a group or 30 minutes if watching alone. When the max playback limit is reached, playback will end. This will start a 10-minute cool-down, after which you can continue watching. This same timer applies no matter what server or voice chat you are in.</span></p>
<h1 id="h_01GXVMQR6SZ61DZBPETZKKN9QS"><span style="color: #2e3338;">Other FAQs</span></h1>

<p><span style="color: #2e3338;">A: You can head to YouTube to watch the livestream individually until your 10 minute cool-down timer is over. Then you can continue watching the Coachella YouTube livestream using Watch Together after the timer is done. </span></p>
