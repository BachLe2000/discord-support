<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/4422142836759" target="_self">Watch Together</a> is a collaborative way to watch YouTube videos with others. In Watch Together, everyone can participate in building a playlist of videos. Watch Together will handle the video syncing for you - no counting down to pressing play!</span></p>
<h2><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-x-large"><strong>HOW TO USE WATCH TOGETHER</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To start Watch Together, follow these steps below!  </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Join a voice channel</span></li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once joined, you should see the Activity Launcher (it looks like a rocket ship) in the voice channel controls.</span></li>
</ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Click the Activity Launcher to open the Activity Shelf"</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then select "Watch Together"</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To add videos to the shared playlist, click a trending video, paste a YouTube video link into the search bar, or search directly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as there are videos in the playlist, they will begin autoplaying in order.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Participants in the session can continue adding videos to the playlist throughout the Watch Together session.</span></p>
<h2><span class="wysiwyg-color-orange120 wysiwyg-font-size-large" style="font-weight: 400;">What does it mean to be Hosting or Sharing?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By default, the person who started Watch Together is Hosting, and they control what’s playing. In hosting mode, anyone can add videos to the playlist, but only the host  can pause, scrub, skip, reorder, and delete any video.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the host wants others to be able to control the video, they can toggle to Sharing mode. When sharing, all participants have controls over the playlist and the current video, and their actions apply to every user in the session. We recommend Hosting when in big groups and Sharing when in small groups!</span></p>
<h2><span class="wysiwyg-color-orange120 wysiwyg-font-size-large" style="font-weight: 400;">If I change the volume, does it change everyone else's volume?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volume changes are always local, so if any user adjusts the volume or mutes the YouTube player, only their own audio is affected.</span></p>
<h2><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-x-large"><strong>PLAYBACK</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Playback of videos is limited to 180 minutes if watching with a group or 30 minutes if watching alone. When the max playback limit is reached, playback will end. This will start a 10-minute cool-down, after which you can continue watching. This same timer applies no matter what server or voice chat you are in.</span></p>
