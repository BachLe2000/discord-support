<h3>And you're all set! Keep in mind that usernames aren't unique, so you do technically have the ability to clone your friends' names. Remember, with great power comes great responsibility.. And it's probably best to not piss off your server mods.</h3>
<p><em>Important note: Username changes are limited to 2 an hour. </em></p>
