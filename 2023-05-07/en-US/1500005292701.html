<h1>Accessing an Age Restricted Server FAQ</h1>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why is a server labeled as age-restricted?</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our </span><a href="https://discord.com/guidelines"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community Guidelines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> require that all adult content posted to Discord be kept behind an age-restricted gate. Server owners can designate </span><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000084051" target="_blank" rel="noopener">specific channels as being 18+</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by adding an age-restricted gate. Entire servers can now be classified as 18+ through the use of an </span><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500005389362" target="_blank" rel="noopener">age-restricted server designation</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Servers must be classified as age-restricted if the community is</span><strong> organized around age-restricted themes or if the majority of the server’s content is focused on 18+ content</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">I CAN’T VIEW OR JOIN age-restricted SERVERS. WHAT DO I DO?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are between the ages of 13 and 17, you will not be able to join or view the content in age-restricted servers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For people age 18 and older, age-restricted servers can only be joined on desktop or Android devices. Those with iOS devices are required to "opt-in on desktop" in order to view age-restricted servers from their iOS device.</span></p>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">How to opt in for iOS:</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Sign in to Discord on desktop and navigate to your User Settings. You can find your User Settings by clicking the gear icon in the bottom left corner of the app.</li>
<li>In the User Settings menu, click on Privacy &amp; Safety.</li>
<li>Find “Allow access to age-restricted content on iOS” and click the toggle. This will let you view age-restricted servers you are already a member of from your iOS device.</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, a subset of age-restricted servers that are </span><strong>specifically focused on explicit pornographic content</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will be blocked entirely on iOS. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">iOS users aged 18+ will only be able to join and access these dedicated pornography servers on the desktop and web versions of Discord.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Note: Only age-restricted server owners and moderators will be allowed to view and manage this specific subset of age-restricted servers on iOS.</strong></h3>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Do I Update my Age Information?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are over the age of 18 and have been locked out of an age-restricted server, you can appeal by following the instructions below: </span></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take a </span><strong>photo of yourself</strong> <strong>holding the following items</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Your face and all of the required information needs to be visible and readable in ONE photo.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><strong>photo ID</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that contains your date of birth, clearly readable</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A piece of paper that shows your </span><strong>full Discord Tag</strong> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">(including your username and the last 4 digits following your username - ex: Wumpus#1234)</span></em>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have taken the photo, submit a request to the Trust &amp; Safety team here:</span><a href="https://dis.gd/request"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">https://dis.gd/request</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and select </span><strong>"Appeals, age update, other questions"</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> under the </span><strong><em>Report Type</em></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> option.</span></p>
<p><strong>Be sure to use the email address associated with your Discord account.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Our Trust &amp; Safety team needs to receive the request directly from the email address associated with the Discord account to protect our users' privacy and security.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the Discord account was not claimed and verified with an email address, our team is unfortunately unable to provide further support.</span></p>
