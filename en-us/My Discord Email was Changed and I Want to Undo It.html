<strong>Note:</strong> Please note that account recovery links will become invalid after a 48 hour time period. Do not share this link to others.</div>
<p>Changing the email on your Discord account is a big deal! That’s why we send you an extra email notification to the original email address after it’s been confirmed. </p>
<p>This message also includes a button to let you revert or undo the email change within 48 hours, as an extra method to keep you in control of your account.</p>

<div class="tip-box">
<strong> Note:</strong> The URL will always start with <a href="https://discord.com/wasntme/">https://discord.com/wasntme/</a> - anything else is fake and not from Discord!</div>
<p>1. To start, press the button in the email notification we sent you that says <strong>Start Account Recovery</strong>. </p>
<p>This link is uniquely generated for your account and is only valid for <strong>48 hours</strong> - don’t share it with anyone!</p>
<p>2. After tapping the link, you’ll be taken to an <strong>Account Recovery</strong> page where you will be able to complete the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change your Discord account’s email back to the previous email address</li>
<li>Log out the Discord account from all devices</li>
<li>Update your password</li>
<li>Remove any phone number on the Discord account</li>
<li>Remove any Multi-Factor Authentication methods on the Discord account</li>
<li>Invalidate existing recovery URLs for email changes to your account made after this one</li>
</ul>

<p>3. To complete the process, follow the instructions after pressing <strong>Start revert process</strong>. </p>
<p>You’ll provide a new password, and then the email address for your Discord account will be reverted to the one we sent the recovery link to - alongside the other changes listed on the page.</p>
<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Note:</strong> If you had a phone number or MFA device enrolled on the account, be sure to add those back after completing the recovery process!

<h1 id="h_01JAZCN933PY69WFM8ZMEQ01KS">I Got an Error When Trying to Undo My Email Change</h1>
<p>For technical reasons, you’ll only see an error when trying to complete the password reset part of this process, and not before that. </p>
<p>Common reasons you could see an error here are:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s been more than <strong>48</strong> <strong>hours</strong> since we sent you the recovery link, and it’s no longer valid.</li>
<li>A recovery has already been performed on this account using a link we sent before the one being used.</li>
<li>The email address that the link was sent to is currently in use by another Discord account. To complete the account recovery, ensure that no other Discord accounts are using that email address.</li>
<li>The password you’re attempting to set is invalid. For example, we don’t accept passwords less than 8 characters, and some regions may have additional password requirements</li>
</ul>

<strong>Note:</strong> If your account recovery link has expired, the Discord support team is not able to send you a new one.</div>
<h1 id="h_01JAZCN9339VG957PD84A1V1CF">How Does the Account Recovery Link Work?</h1>
<p>To ensure the security of the account (and prevent scammers from regaining access to the account after you perform the recovery), the following restrictions are in place for the recovery process:</p>
<ul>
<li>The link is only valid for <strong>48 hours</strong>.</li>
<li>If multiple recovery links have been generated for an account, using one will invalidate any that were created after the one that was used.</li>
<li>Any phone number and <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/219576828" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MFA devices</a> associated with the account are removed.</li>
<li>You are required to change your password during this process (in case someone knows your current password), and the Discord account will be logged out from all devices.</li>
</ul>
