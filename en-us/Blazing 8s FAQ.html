<h1 id="h_01GESS6TZ45Q4HK60NVQTKNGC7">What is Blazing 8s?</h1>
<p>Blazing 8s is an <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/4422142836759" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Activity</a> that we've developed here at Discord. It is our Crazy Eights-inspired card game that you can play with your friends! The rules are simple — on your turn, discard a card from your hand with the same suit or number as the previous card. Playing special cards allows you to skip other players, reverse the direction of play, and even swap hands with other players. The first person to discard all their cards wins!</p>

<p>3. Each player gets a turn to either play a card from your hand or draw a card (if you don’t have a card you can play). You need to match the color of the card that has been placed already, match the card type, or you can play a specialty card.</p>

<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: Why is Discord adding games into voice channels?</strong></span></p>
<p>A: We started Discord because we are all about bringing people together around gaming. As Discord has grown, we've seen more and more people use Discord to come together around games. For instance, we’ve seen people use Discord to not only play <em>League</em> but also to hang out and play more casual, social games with friends like <em>Jackbox</em> and <em>Among Us</em>.</p>

<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: Is there an age requirement?</strong></span></p>
<p>A: There is no age requirement for Blazing 8s</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: How do I play?</strong></span></p>

<p>A: Blazing 8s is a game for 2-5 players. However, more members can join the activity as spectators and join the queue to play in future hands.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: Where can I report bugs and problems with the game?</strong></span></p>
<p>A: You'll be able to submit a bug report by going to <a href="https://dis.gd/bugreport" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://dis.gd/bugreport</a></p>

<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Q: How do I view/delete my Activities on Discord data? What data is tracked?</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: You can view data for Discord-developed Activities like <em>Checkers in the Park</em> through the <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/360004027692" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord Privacy and Safety settings</a>. </span>To enhance the gameplay experience, Discord Activities access and temporarily store the following user data once a user joins the Activity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discord ID</li>
<li>Avatar</li>
<li>Username</li>
</ul>
<p>For Activities played in a single session, user data is stored so long as the Activity remains active, even if the user leaves the Activity. Once all users leave the Activity and it is determined the Activity has ended, the user data is deleted and no longer retained.</p>
<p>For Activities that can be played across multiple sessions (like with Chess in the Park or Checkers in the Park), the user data above is retained. </p>
<h3 id="h_01HRAT8KZRNZY3CWW1HEXJM7T9">Note: Deleting your data will remove all of your progression across these Discord-developed activities.</h3>
