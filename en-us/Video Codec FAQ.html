<h1 id="h_01GRYP12ARHVP4GB639X9S1JE7"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Is a Video Codec?</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Video codec is a software or hardware that compresses and decompresses digital video so that it can be transmitted over the Internet. Video codec is a key component when it comes to high quality streams. This means that the better the codec, the better the video quality. <span style="color: #2e3338;">Discord supports several video codecs, and selects the best one supported by all the call participants.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="h_01GRYP19WAYHBHKDVT855HNSM1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is H.264?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">H.264 is a very widely adopted technical standard of video codec. Almost every device nowadays (this includes both desktop and mobile devices) uses a software and hardware codec that is compatible with the H.264 standard. Since H.264 was developed in the early 2000’s, the encoding algorithms were targeted mainly for standard definition (480p) video compression.</span></p>
<h2 id="h_01GRYP1FMKTKBCHQ198JCPM0Q1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is AV1?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AV1 is one of the latest technical standards of video codec. It is developed by AOM (Alliance for open media), which is sponsored by most key players in video communications like Google, Apple, Netflix, and Meta. It uses the most sophisticated algorithms to improve video compression efficiency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In contrast to H.264, AV1 is developed to better support HD/UHD video communications, especially 4k, or even 8k, video applications. The AV1 codec employed by Discord presents up to 100% higher compression efficiency than its H.264 counterpart for 4K 60fps videos. </span></p>
<h3 id="h_01HYZZDAMB2X1QJ51F9J4NBQ3R">
<span style="color: #434343;">Currently, sending AV1 video is only supported via Windows desktop with more recent </span><a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/video-encode-and-decode-gpu-support-matrix-new"><span class="wysiwyg-underline" style="color: #1155cc;">NVidia GPUs</span></a><span style="color: #434343;">. See Nvidia’s </span><a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/video-encode-and-decode-gpu-support-matrix-new"><span class="wysiwyg-underline" style="color: #1155cc;">support matrix</span></a><span style="color: #434343;"> to see if your GPU supports AV1 encoding. However, all desktop viewers can still watch AV1 streams regardless of their hardware.</span>
