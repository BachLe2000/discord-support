<p><span style="color: #434343;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Bobble League has two game modes to choose from: <br>- <strong>Private Game</strong>: allows only the players who are currently in the same voice channel within a server to play. Select <strong>Private Game</strong> in the lower right corner and then choose a team and mascot. 8 players can play, but more can spectate.<br>- <strong>Public Matchmaking</strong>: This mode allows you to play alone or with a group of friends and be matched to play against players across other servers. <br>Join a team with those in the same voice channel to get matched against another team. If you decide to play alone, select<strong> Play Now</strong> to get matched with a team to play with.<br></span></p>
<h3 id="h_01HPSB0T4PABD09RAKAT9SVY7Y"><span style="color: #434343;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Note: While in <strong>Public Game</strong> mode, you can hide your name and avatar in the game by checking <strong>Play Anonymously</strong> on the start screen (this option is selected by default). Additionally, you can only use voice chat and text chat with those in the same voice channel as you, regardless of being in a public or private game.</span></h3>

<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: Why is Discord adding games into voice channels?</strong></span></p>
<p>A: We started Discord because we are all about bringing people together around gaming. As Discord has grown, we've seen more and more people use Discord to come together around games. For instance, we’ve seen people use Discord to not only play <em>League</em> but also to hang out and play more casual, social games with friends like <em>Jackbox</em> and <em>Among Us</em>.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: Is there an age requirement?</strong></span></p>
<p>A: There is no age requirement for Bobble League.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: How do I play?</strong></span></p>
<p>A: To start a game, first join one of the voice channels. Once there, you should see the Activity Launcher (it looks like a rocket ship) in the voice channel controls. Click the Activity Launcher to open the Activity Shelf, and then select "Bobble League".</p>
