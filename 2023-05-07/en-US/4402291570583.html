<h1><strong>HOW DO I REDEEM NITRO ON MY DISCORD ACCOUNT? </strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have received the link in your email, you'll now need to officially redeem this gift on your Discord account (or share this Nitro with a friend)! </span></p>
<h2 id="h_01F7S1MD8A9PXMAQRFFQG2KM55"><strong>ELIGIBILITY FOR REDEEMING NITRO ON DISCORD</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only first-time Nitro subscribers where Discord Nitro and Epic Games Store are both available can redeem the 3 months of Nitro by July 24, 2021 (10:59AM EDT), and once redeemed, the promo must be redeemed in your Discord account by July 24, 2021 (10:59AM EDT). </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have previously subscribed to Nitro at any point in time, you will not be able to redeem this promotion! </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Discord detects that you have previously purchased a subscription, or that you have an active gifted subscription, you will see an error message (like this one shown below)!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, if you do not meet these requirements, you won't be able to redeem this Nitro promotion on your own Discord account. However, you can copy and paste the promo link to share with a friend! </span></p>

</ul>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large wysiwyg-color-blue90"><strong>Q: Why do I need to submit my payment info to redeem Nitro?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: Because Nitro is a subscription plan, at the end of your free 3 month trial, we will start your first billing cycle so you can continue to enjoy Nitro on Discord.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, you can cancel the Nitro subscription at any time before the end of the three months!</span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large wysiwyg-color-blue90"><strong>Q: Why do I see a hold on my account when this is supposed to be a free promotion?<br></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: Just to clarify, this Nitro promotion is free, however, there will be a <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4402712000663" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">temporary hold</a> placed on the payment method upon activating the promotion. This is to help Discord confirm the payment method works as expected and to prevent the use of fraudulent payment methods. This charge will appear in your Discord transaction history, and it may appear as a hold on your payment method. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We immediately reverse the temporary hold, and you’ll see that reflected in your Discord transaction history. Your bank may take longer to remove the hold from your payment method. Note: Banks will usually remove the temporary hold from your account within a few business days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your Discord transaction history does not show the hold released after 5 business days, please let us know at</span><a href="https://dis.gd/contact"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">https://dis.gd/contact</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and our support team will be able to investigate this issue further.</span></p>
