<h2 id="h_01J0KH7RTHKDDP0F9B2G3NR36T">Friend Request Failed</h2>
<p>If you go to add a friend and you receive the warning “<strong>Friend Request Failed</strong>” this is because the user is not accepting friend requests. They will need to add you as a friend instead - as this means they have their Friend Requests setting disabled. </p>

<h2 id="h_01J0KH7RTHDFV75FZMEZ4D5MJA">Double Check that the Username is Correct</h2>
<p>If you receive an error message that states “<strong>Hm, didn’t work. Double check that the username is correct.</strong>” - then it means the username was not typed or pasted correctly. </p>
<p>The username needs to be exact, or the friend request will not go through - so double check each number, letter, underscore, or period you’ve typed and then try submitting the request again.</p>
<p>If you’re still running into an issue adding the friend after confirming that you’ve typed their username correctly, you’ll need to reach out to them to see if they can send you a friend request instead.</p>
