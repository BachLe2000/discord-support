<h1 id="h_01HHQ2QR09R9W4XMY49J68454Y">Submitting Requests Regarding Deceased or Incapacitated Users on Discord</h1>
<p>At Discord, we understand that dealing with the accounts of deceased or incapacitated users can be a sensitive and challenging situation. We are here to guide you through the process of submitting requests regarding their Discord account while ensuring privacy and security for all parties involved. </p>
<h2 id="h_01HHQ2QR096QBF3G6K9H5NY1QV">Requesting Access or Details for the Deceased’s Account</h2>
<p>Due to privacy and security reasons, we are unable to provide access, disclose personal information, make changes, or share data tied to an account. However, if you have access to the email address associated with the account, you can initiate a password reset. This process allows you to regain access to the account without compromising privacy and security. To learn more about how to reset a password, please refer to this <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/218410947-I-forgot-my-Password-Where-can-I-set-a-new-one-" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">support article</a>.</p>
<h2 id="h_01HHQ2QR09NR2GCGKF2SCFVS1T">Requesting Account Deletion</h2>
<p><strong>If you have access to the deceased user’s </strong><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Discord accoun</span></strong><strong>t </strong>you can follow the steps below to initiate the account deletion process:</p>
<p>1. Log into the deceased user's Discord account on the mobile or desktop application or <a href="http://discordapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discordapp.com</a>.</p>
<p>2. Enter the <strong>User Settings</strong> by clicking on the <strong>cog icon</strong> on the bottom left of your Discord app.</p>
<p>3. Once you’re in the <strong>My Account</strong> tab (it should be the default tab), scroll down to the section titled <strong>Account Removal</strong>.</p>
<p>4. Click on the <strong>Delete Account</strong> button, and you’ll be prompted to enter the password for this Discord account.</p>
<p>5. After you have confirmed the deletion, you will be immediately logged out of the account and the deletion process will begin.</p>
<p>For more information about account deletion, check out our Support article:<a href="https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/212500837" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/212500837</a>.</p>
<p><strong>If you have access to the deceased user’s </strong><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">email address</span></strong><strong> or if you are </strong><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">writing in from the email associated with the account</span></strong><strong>:</strong></p>
<p>You can request account deletion by including the following sentence in your request: <br><strong><em>"I confirm that I would like to delete the account associated with [emailaddress@email.com]."</em></strong> while replacing the email address with the email address in question. Once we receive the request above, we will be able to begin the account deletion process. </p>
<p><strong>If you are requesting account deletion from </strong><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">a different account or email address</span></strong><strong>:</strong></p>
<p>Since Discord prioritizes user privacy and does not collect extensive personal information on our users, verifying the identity and relationship of the requester is crucial. In order to proceed with account-related actions, the following documentation must be provided:</p>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Document Submission Guidelines:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Explicit Confirmation of Action Requested:</strong></p>

<h1 id="h_01HHQ2QR099J80CCYJ5RVWAPF9">Inactive Account Deletion</h1>
<p>Discord accounts that have not been used for 2 years or more may be scheduled to be deleted due to inactivity.

As long as no one logs into the account in question, the deletion will proceed automatically. </p>
