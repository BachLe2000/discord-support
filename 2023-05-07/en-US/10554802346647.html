<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">g. You are responsible for all of your own expenses associated with participating in the Contest.</span></p>
<p><strong>5. Identity of Entrant:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Each potential winner may be required to provide Discord with proof that the potential winner is the authorized account holder of the account associated with the winning Submission. Multiple participants are not permitted to share the same account.  </span></p>
<p><strong>6. Selection and Notification of Winner:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> On or before Monday, December 12th, 2022, a panel of judges selected at Discord’s discretion and based in the U.S. will score each Submission based on the following criteria (“</span><strong><em>Judging Criteria</em></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">”):</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judging Criteria  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1)     Accuracy (⅓);</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2)     Expression and posing  (⅓); and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3)     Set design and background (⅓).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The five (5) winners (three (3) winners for Most Creative, one (1) winner for Best Traditional, and one (1) winner for Best Digital) will be determined based on an assessment of each Submission against the Judging Criteria by a panel of three (3) Discord employees on Discord’s Community team and Art School team.  In the unlikely event of a tie, a member of Discord’s Brand/Experiential team will cast the deciding vote on the winning Submission.  The selection of the winners is at the sole discretion of the judges and the judges’ decision is final.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each potential winner will be notified via Discord ID on or about Monday, December 12th, 2022. To receive a prize, a potential winner must submit all information that Discord requires to deliver them their prize and comply with applicable laws. Unless Discord is satisfied that a potential winner is eligible to win a prize, every potential winner must sign and return to Discord an affidavit of eligibility. An affidavit of eligibility is a document in which the signatory legally declares that they are eligible to win the prize based on these Official Rules. If Discord asks a potential winner to sign and return to Discord an affidavit of eligibility, they must do so within 30 days of the date the affidavit is sent to claim their prize. If (i) the attempted notification is returned as undeliverable without a forwarding address; (ii) any required information or documents are not returned within seven days, such as the Affidavit of Eligibility; or (iii) the potential winner chooses not to, or is otherwise unable to, accept the prize as stated, the prize will be forfeited and will be awarded to an alternate winner in accordance with the Judging Criteria. Only one alternate winner will be selected for the prize.</span></p>

The parties expressly waive any ability to maintain any Class Action in any forum. Any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction.

<p><strong>15. Uncontrollable Events.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In the event the operation or integrity of the Contest is compromised by an event beyond Discord’s reasonable control and which were unforeseeable before the Contest began, Discord may suspend, modify or terminate the Contest.</span></p>
<p><strong>16. General Conditions:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Discord’s failure to enforce any term of these Official Rules will not constitute a waiver of that provision.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of these rules shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision. In the event that any such provision is determined to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, these rules shall be construed in accordance with their terms as if the invalid or unenforceable provision was not contained therein. The use of the terms “include” or “including” in these Official Rules is illustrative and not limiting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you participate in the Draw a Wumpus Contest (“</span><strong>Event</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">”), we, Discord Inc., 444 De Haro Street, Suite 200, San Francisco, CA 94107, collect the personal information that you submit with your entry into the Event. This personal information may include your name, submission, and photo. We use it for the purposes of administering the Event in accordance with its Official Rules, and exercising or discharging Discord’s rights and obligations under applicable law. Your submission will be visible to all users of the service to which you posted your submission. We disclose personal information to our service providers in Canada (excluding Quebec), France, Germany, Great Britain, Japan, Mexico, or the 50 United States and D.C. who process it only on our behalf and subject to confidentiality agreements and other appropriate data protection measures. For additional information about how we protect and use personal information, your privacy rights, and our representatives in certain jurisdictions, please see our privacy policy at http://www.discord.com/privacy/.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are laws in the jurisdictions where we are running this Event that require us to disclose the personal information of Event entrants and winners to government entities so that they can ensure that we are running this Event fairly and in compliance with applicable consumer protection, marketing and other laws. If a government entity requests these details, we will provide them to the government entity. Under the GDPR, the lawful basis for this disclosure is to advance our legitimate interests in running an Event that complies with applicable laws.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certain U.S. and British laws require us to publish or disclose the names (and in some cases countries) of winners to third parties that request this information from us. These laws are intended to ensure that we run the Event fairly and in compliance with applicable laws. If you are selected as a potential winner of the Event, a condition of claiming a prize and becoming a winner of the Event is that we may disclose your name and country for this purpose. This is a necessary part of our contract with you when you accept a prize to win the Event because our contract requires us to comply with the laws that apply to us and applicable laws require us to make these disclosures. Under the GDPR, the lawful basis for this disclosure is to perform our contract with you to run the Event in accordance with applicable laws, or else to advance our legitimate interests in running an Event that complies with applicable laws. Discord retains personal information submitted during the Event for as long as necessary to administer the Event and comply with applicable laws. You can contact giveaways@discordapp.com for more information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you post a submission as part of the Event, Discord may separately request your consent to retain and use your personal information or other information in your submission for promotional purposes. </span><strong>You are not required to provide such consent to enter or win the Event and providing your consent will not increase your chances of winning.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Participation in the Event is voluntary but we require some personal information from you to enter you into the Event, and you cannot win a prize unless we may disclose your name and country to third parties where required by applicable laws.</span></p>
