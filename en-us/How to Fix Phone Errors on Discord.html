<p>A phone can only be registered with one Discord account at a time. If you are encountering an error that states <strong>This phone number is unable to be associated with this account</strong>, this is because the phone number is already tied to another account. As you can only have one number per account, you would need to remove the number from the other account Discord in order to use it.</p>

<p>Make sure that the phone number you are entering is properly formatted and is valid according to your country’s numbering plan. </p>
<p>Also, make sure the phone number is not associated with a landline or VOIP device, and that the number you are trying to use is associated with a mobile device.</p>
