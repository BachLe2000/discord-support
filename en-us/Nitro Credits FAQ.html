<ul>
<li>
<strong>No Nitro subscription</strong>: credits activate instantly upon earning them.</li>
<li>
<strong>Active Nitro subscription</strong>: credits activate automatically at the end of your current billing cycle. </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="h_01JDB0ACQVRXHEGB6Q5W0TPGP2">Nitro Subscription with 2 Boosts</h2>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>You <strong>cannot</strong> purchase more Boosts or cancel existing ones while nitro credits are active.</li>
