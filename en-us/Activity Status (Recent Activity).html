<h1 id="h_01HTJA8QV5YFRR10TQ9RBZM8SS">What is Activity Status (Recent Activity)?</h1>
<p>When you engage in certain detectable activities (like playing a game or listening to music), Discord can display information about those activities. This includes when and how you engaged, as well as information about the activity. Some examples of the types of activity we show:</p>
<ol>
<li>Detectable games you’re playing on a computer</li>
<li>Games you’re playing on <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003953831-Discord-and-Xbox-Connection-FAQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox</a> or <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4419534960919-Discord-and-PlayStation-Network-Connection-FAQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Playstation</a>

</li>
<li>And more!</li>
</ol>
<p>Games and activities that support Rich Presence will show even more cool stuff about what’s happening in the activity. </p>
<p>And some activities from other services like Spotify or Crunchyroll require you to connect your account to Discord. You can learn more about these through our connections article <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/8063233404823-Connections-Linked-Roles-Community-Members" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. </p>
