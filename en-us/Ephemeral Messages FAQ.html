<p><strong>Q: What is this kind of message?</strong></p>
<p>A: An "Ephemeral Message" is a message sent by Clyde/Discord and <a href="https://support-apps.discord.com/hc/articles/26593412574359" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">apps that utilize bots for communication</a>. It's a message that only you can see. These messages disappear when you dismiss them, wait long enough, or restart Discord.</p>
<p><strong>Q: When can bots send me ephemeral messages?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Q: Help! The message disappeared!</strong></p>
<p>A: Ephemeral Messages are designed to not stick around forever. They'll disappear after a little bit of time, or when you restart Discord.Â </p>
