<a id="_h2yrwg7pjr5"></a><strong>Payment Info and Subscription Questions</strong>
</h2><p><strong>Q: Why do I need to submit my payment info to redeem Nitro?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> Because Nitro is a subscription plan, at the end of your free 1 month trial, we will start your first billing cycle so you can continue to enjoy Nitro on Discord.</p><p>However, you can cancel the Nitro subscription at any time before the end of the 1 month.</p><p><strong>Q: Why do I see a temporary hold/charge on my account when this is supposed to be a free promotion?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> Just to clarify, this Nitro promotion is free, however, there will be a <strong>temporary hold</strong> placed on the payment method upon activating the promotion. This is to help Discord confirm the payment method works as expected and to prevent the use of fraudulent payment methods. This charge will appear in your Discord transaction history, and it may appear as a hold on your payment method.</p><p>We immediately reverse the temporary hold, and you’ll see that reflected in your Discord transaction history. Your bank may take longer to remove the hold from your payment method.</p><h3>
<a id="_6sigakyubkdr"></a><strong>Note: Banks will usually remove the temporary hold from your account within a few business days.</strong>
</h3><p>If your Discord transaction history does not show the hold released after 5 business days, please let us know at<a href="https://dis.gd/contact"> https://dis.gd/contact</a>, and our support team will be able to investigate this issue further.</p><h2>
