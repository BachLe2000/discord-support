<h1>Age-Restricted Commands</h1>
<h1><strong>WHAT ARE AGE-RESTRICTED COMMANDS?</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Age-restricted commands are </span><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000368501" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commands from apps</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that may contain age-restricted content, and may only be used by people 18 or older. To ensure that Discord is safe for everyone, our policies require that developers label adult content as age-restricted and not distribute it to people under the age of 18.</span></p>
<h1><strong>WHO CAN USE AGE-RESTRICTED COMMANDS?</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users who are 18 and older can access them in servers and DMs.</span></p>
<h1><strong>WHERE CAN THEY BE USED?</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They can be used within </span><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000084051" target="_blank" rel="noopener">age-restricted channels</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in servers, and in DMs after a user has opted-in to use them.</span></p>
<h1><strong>HOW DO I ACCESS AGE-RESTRICTED COMMANDS?</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In servers, you can use these commands only within </span><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000084051" target="_blank" rel="noopener">age-restricted channels</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Not all apps have age-restricted commands, but if an app in your server has them, they’ll only be accessible within those designated channels.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In DMs, age-restricted commands are </span><strong>turned off by default. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">If an app contains age-restricted commands, you can access them by enabling the toggle within </span><strong>User Settings &gt; Privacy</strong><strong>&gt; Server Privacy Defaults.</strong></p>
<h1><strong>HELP! I'M OVER 18 YEARS OLD, BUT CAN’T USE AGE-RESTRICTED COMMANDS!</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are over the age of 18 and have been locked out of an age-restricted channel, or are unable to use age-restricted commands in DMs, you can appeal by following the instructions below. </span></p>
<h2><strong>WHAT DO WE NEED TO UNLOCK ACCESS? </strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step 1: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take a photo of yourself that includes yourself holding the following items:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">photo ID</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that contains your date of birth</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A piece of paper that shows your </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">full Discord Tag </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">(including your username and the last 4 digits following your username - ex: Wumpus#1234)</span></em>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step 2: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have taken the photo, submit a request to the Trust &amp; Safety team here: </span><a href="https://dis.gd/request" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://dis.gd/request</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and select “Appeals, age update, other questions” and then "Update my age information".</span></p>
<h3>
<strong>Note:</strong><br><strong>- All of the required information needs to be visible and readable in ONE photo.</strong><br><strong>- You must send the photo with the email address associated with your Discord account</strong><br><strong>The information you provide will only be used to verify your age and will not be used for any other purpose.</strong>
