<li>The server has 100 members.</li>
<li>The current server owner hasn't accessed their account for at least a month.</li>
<li>You (the requestor) have been active on your account in the last 30 days.</li>
<li>You (the requestor) have administrator or moderator permissions within the server.</li>
</ul>
<div class="warn-box">Our Support team can only assist with server ownership transfers if your request meets the criteria. If your request does not meet the criteria, then it will be denied— no exceptions.</div>

<h2 id="h_01J7F7G7QAF13AMMMGD453V2Z9">How do I find a Server/User ID?</h2>
<p>1. You must enable <strong>Developer Mode</strong> on your Discord app before you can find the server/user ID. You can check out this support article on <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/206346498" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how you can enable developer mode on your Discord app</a>.</p>
<p>2. After you’ve enabled <strong>Developer Mode</strong>, you can now find and copy a server ID and a User ID.</p>
<p>To find the user ID, right-click a user’s avatar and then select <strong>Copy User ID</strong>. You can also press on a user’s avatar &gt; press on the <strong>ellipses icon</strong> in the top right corner of the user’s profile &gt; select <strong>Copy User ID</strong>.</p>
<p>To find a server ID, right-click the server’s name or the server icon and then select <strong>Copy User ID</strong>.</p>
<div class="warn-box">Please note that we cannot transfer ownership if you’re asking on behalf of another user, and you will need to ask that other user to directly contact our support team with their own transfer request! The new owner should be the one submitting the support ticket, unless your server is Partnered or Verified.</div>
<h1 id="h_01J7F7PP92JRTF5006QJ1X6HM2">What if my Server is Partnered or Verified?</h1>
<p>Before submitting a ticket, <span class="wysiwyg-underline">please check if your server is part of either the Partnered or Verified programs</span>. If your server is Partnered or Verified, you will have the corresponding badge next to your server’s name. You can learn more about <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/14078261239831" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">server types on this support article</a>.</p>
<div class="warn-box">Please note that if your server has the <strong>Community Feature</strong> enabled, then this is not included in the Partner or Verified program. When submitting your transfer request, please only select <strong>Yes</strong> under <strong>Is your server Partnered, Verified?</strong> if your server is confirmed to be Partnered or Verified, not Community. Choosing incorrectly could delay your request processing.</div>
<p>After confirming that the server is part of our Partner or Verified program, only the server owner can submit an ownership transfer request.</p>
<h1 id="h_01J7F84ST9CK89DKAHPK6AM7Y7">What if I Want to Request an Ownership Transfer of Multiple Servers?</h1>
<p>Our team can only handle one server per request. Therefore, if you want to request ownership of multiple servers, we ask that you file a separate ticket for each one.</p>
<h1 id="h_01J7F85919XBQF71N75ASKJAR2">Will the Inactive Server Owner be Notified of the Server Transfer?</h1>
<p>If a server owner is inactive and not banned, then we do contact them to get their consent for the server ownership transfer. The current server owner has 7 days to respond to our inquiry. If they approve the transfer or they don’t respond within 7 days, we transfer the server if eligible per our requirements. If the current owner denies the transfer request or the criteria for transfer is not met, we will not be able to proceed with the transfer of the server.</p>
<h1 id="h_01J7F85Q2GC0CWCWTRMWYP5J38">A Note on Data and Your Privacy</h1>
<p>In line with data minimization principles, information provided by you in your server ownership transfer request will be deleted after the transfer is complete.</p>
<p>We take your privacy and data security seriously. The information collected during the server ownership transfer process, including the server name, server ID, inactive owner's Discord username and user ID, and the new owner's Discord username and user ID, will be used solely for processing your transfer request. This data will be handled confidentially and in accordance with <a href="https://discord.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord’s Privacy Policy</a> and applicable data protection laws.</p>
