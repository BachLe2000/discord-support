<p>Listening to something on your Bluetooth headset and noticing a drop in quality when joining a Discord call? The headphones are probably switching to the Bluetooth “headset” profile. This is required for low latency and microphone functionality on most Bluetooth headphones, but it provides a lower quality audio experience. </p>
<p>This is a known limitation of the Bluetooth standard that affects all apps with voice call support. The new Bluetooth 5.3 Low Energy (<a href="https://www.bluetooth.com/learn-about-bluetooth/feature-enhancements/le-audio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LE Audio</a>) standard–supported by select phones and headsets–introduces new functionality to help resolve it. Both the headset and the phone need to support LE Audio. Consult your phone and headset specifications to see if LE Audio is supported.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HHMVSBBQZMEF1FZNBNA1P3GG"><span style="color: #434343;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Support for LE Audio is coming soon to Discord, so stay tuned. </span></h3>
