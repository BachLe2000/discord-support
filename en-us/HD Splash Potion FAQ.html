<p><strong>Q: What happens if a person with low bandwidth is watching my HD Splash Potion stream?</strong></p>
<p>A: The effect of the HD Splash Potion can be impacted by the technical limitations of your or your fellow streamers' device or bandwidth. HD streaming capability may be limited if people watching your stream have low bandwidth or are tuning in from an unsupported device. To ensure that everyone in the call can benefit from the HD Splash Potion, make sure everyone in the call has a strong internet connection and is watching from a desktop device.</p>
