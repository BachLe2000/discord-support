<p>Your Server Boosting Badge and streak is based on the length of time that you have been boosting a server. Regardless of how many servers you boost, the length of your streak is dependent on the oldest applied server boost(s). You can see your boosting streak by tapping on your avatar icon to reveal your user profile and hovering over your Server Boosting badge.</p>
<p>You can lose your boosting streak for any of the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>You cancel your Server Boost(s)</li>
<li>The server you have been boosting has been deleted </li>
<li>You’ve been removed from the server by an admin or moderator</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h_01HGX7DJ34ARGWRP4KH9YTBSW1"><span style="color: #434343;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">If you stop boosting a server for any of the listed reasons, you have 72 hours to reapply your boosts to a new server in order to maintain your streak. If you do not boost another server within 72 hours, you will lose your streak and our Support Team can not adjust your streak.</span></h3>

<h3 id="h_01HGX7DJ34ERHGKWPPKZNVR70D"><span style="color: #434343;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">After using your Server Boost, you’ll need to wait 7 days for the cooldown before transferring it to another server.</span></h3>
<p>If you accidentally boosted the wrong server, or you just want to move your boost, you can easily transfer your Server Boost to another server! Just keep in mind, if you move your boost to another server, the original server might lose a server boost level. Here’s how to transfer your boost.</p>
<p>1. Tap on <strong>cogwheel</strong> next to your Discord username to access your <strong>User Settings</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Next, navigate to the <strong>Server Boost</strong> tab.</p>
<p>3. Here you should see the current servers that your Server Boosts are applied to. Tap on the 3 dots next to the Server Boost that you want to move, and then tap on <strong>Transfer Boost</strong>.</p>
<p>4. You can either search for the name of the server you want to transfer the boost to, or you can tap on <strong>Transfer here</strong> if you see the server in the list. In order for a server to show up in the list, you <em>must</em> be a member of the server.</p>
<p>5. Now just tap on <strong>Yes, Transfer Boost</strong>  to transfer the Server Boost.</p>
<p>6. Finally you’ll see a confirmation message stating it has been transferred successfully.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/C6PRZDKbcamFtCX4UA8Bx1MI9S3dCWx-MMtLxwSTB6Ph0dpQP8QDJ6n3YWyTmAip-bG0SIe1w3UO1peoiHeRk5xTLhCx7FPRJ9JsJxYU0aQusYt76OQT-OPidyGbDjQJ70PHfQEhIUZevWN3gnK_ehU" width="624" height="351"></p>
<h1 id="h_01HGX7DJ34RX96KX2RBPEANZKB">Server Owner/Admin View Of Server Boosts</h1>
<p>If someone uses a Server Boost on your server, and you have the option enabled, you’ll see a message in your designated text channel that states someone has boosted the server.</p>
<p id="h_01HGX7DJ349T9DMNMG7KYZN2TP" class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><span style="color: #434343;" data-darkreader-inline-color=""><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/19576208168215" width="380" height="47"></span></p>
<p>If you're the server owner or have <strong>Manage Server</strong> permissions, you'll be able to select which channel the Server Boosting message will appear in, or toggle this option on/off within the <strong>Overview</strong> section in your <strong>Server Settings</strong>. Here’s how:</p>
<p>1. Navigate to the server you own or have <strong>Manage Server Permissions</strong> in, and then tap on the server name in the top-left corner of the app.</p>
<p>2. Tap on <strong>Server Settings </strong>and then under <strong>Overview,</strong> scroll down until you see <strong>System Messages Channel.</strong></p>
<p>3. Here you can change where the system message is sent to and can also enable or disable <strong>Send a message when someone boosts this server.</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><strong><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/19576232995223" width="624" height="268"></strong></p>
<p>If you’re the server owner or have <strong>Manage Server</strong> permissions within the server, you’ll also be able to go behind the scenes and head into the <strong>Server Boost Status </strong>tab in your <strong>Server Settings </strong>and see:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your server’s current level + perks</li>
<li>How many people blessed the server with Boosts</li>
<li>And how many more Boosts you need before your server reaches the next level</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/19576232999191" width="624" height="488"></p>
<p>If your server is running low on Server Boosts and loses a level, the server will be able to keep the perks for a grace period of 3 days. After 3 days, the perks (such as the server banner and extra emojis) will not be fully removed from the server, but will become temporarily invalid until the level is regained.</p>
<p>However, the Custom Invite Link will be lost and become available to other servers after 3 days. </p>
