<h3 id="h_01HE36A0HNDEVEY5X0XE2J1M0Z">Please note: The Discord support team does not have the ability to add this offer to user accounts or make an account eligible to redeem this trial.</h3>
<p id="docs-internal-guid-28377a92-7fff-842d-302c-432e40de01a4"><strong>Q: Why don't I see this offer in my Discord app?</strong></p>
<p>A: If you do not see the offer in your Discord app under the Nitro tab in the User Settings between November 7th and 13th, 2023, that means that your account is ineligible for this offer based on one of the eligibility terms. Please note that the Discord support team does not have the ability to add this offer to user accounts or make an account eligible to redeem this trial.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What happens if I have an active Server Boosting subscription?</strong></p>
<p>If a user has had a Server Boosting membership active on their account and they have not had a Nitro membership within the last 30 days, redeeming this promotion will replace that original Server Boosting membership. This promotion will replace that original Server Boosting Membership with a Nitro Membership which includes 2 free boosts!

<p><strong>Q: Can I redeem the trial on mobile?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, you can redeem the Nitro 2-week trial on Android and limited iOS mobile devices! </p>
<h3 id="h_01HE36AFYCSG72DQ6BHYMYPZZV">Please note: if you don’t see the trial on your mobile device, head over to the Nitro settings page on desktop to check for availability. </h3>
<p><strong>Q: How long is this trial for?</strong></p>
<p>A: Eligible users will be able to claim this Nitro 2-week trial from <strong>November 7th, 2023</strong> to <strong>November 13th, 2023 (11:59pm PST)</strong>. </p>
<p>After <strong>November 13th, 2023 (11:59pm PST)</strong>, eligible users will no longer be able to claim the 2-week trial. </p>
<p>Once the trial has been claimed, Nitro trial users will have 2-weeks to enjoy Nitro! </p>
<p><strong>Q: Why do I need to submit my payment info to redeem Nitro?</strong></p>
<p>A: Because Nitro is a membership, at the end of your 2 week trial, we will start your first billing cycle so you can continue to enjoy Nitro.</p>
<p>However, you can <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000435108-What-are-Nitro-Nitro-Basic-#h_01GFV3PNMEJEF92W0XX69MEE2W" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cancel Nitro</a> at any time, including during trial. To cancel Nitro on desktop, head to your <strong>User Settings </strong>&gt; select <strong>Subscriptions</strong> &gt; press <strong>Cancel </strong>within the Nitro banner. These steps may appear slightly different on mobile.  </p>
<h3 id="h_01HE35R8SE6YGJPBAT5K3W8HP6">Please Note: You will not be charged until the trial ends and the membership renews. We’ll send an email before the paid membership begins, and you’ll have the opportunity to cancel before you are charged by following the steps here.</h3>
<p><strong>Q: Why do I see a temporary hold/charge on my account when this is supposed to be a trial?</strong></p>
<p>A: There is no charge for this 2-week Nitro trial. However, there will be a <strong>temporary hold</strong> placed on the payment method upon activating the promotion. This is to help Discord confirm that the submitted payment method is valid. This charge will appear in your Discord transaction history, and it may appear as a hold on your payment method.</p>
<p>After you redeem the trial offer, we reverse the temporary hold to return the funds, and you’ll see that reflected in your Discord transaction history. Your bank may take longer to remove the hold from your payment method.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HE35R8SENS49FR8XRP6XYPX0">Please note: Banks will usually remove the temporary hold from your account within a few business days.</h3>
<p>If your Discord transaction history does not show the hold released after 5 business days, please let us know at<a href="https://dis.gd/contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> https://dis.gd/contact</a>, and our support team will be able to investigate this issue further.</p>
