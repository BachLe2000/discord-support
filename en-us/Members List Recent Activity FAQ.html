<h1 id="h_01HRZ59A41YS32ZJVG8XK9W998">What is the Members List Recent Activity Feature?</h1>
<h3 id="h_01HRZ59A41MYQCS32MT16QRG1V"><span style="color: #434343;">This feature is currently in beta. It is limited to a small percentage of users within English-prominent regions and available only on the desktop app. This being the case, the experiment is subject to change or may be removed.</span></h3>
<p>Want to easily catch up with your friends and create more shared experiences together?</p>
<p>With the <strong>Members List Recent Activity </strong>feature, you’ll be able to view the recent activities of your friends and recent contacts - including the video games they’re playing, the music they’re listening to, and much more!</p>

<h2 id="h_01HRZ59A41FYWYQ04F9M5G6A1T">Viewing Activity Cards</h2>
<p>With the <strong>Members List Recent Activity</strong> feature, you’ll be able to view <strong>activity cards </strong>within Discord. <strong>Activity cards</strong> will show live and recent activities of those you’ve interacted with - within servers and your friends. </p>
<p>If an activity is currently taking place, it’ll show an incrementing timer for how much time has elapsed. Otherwise, it’ll show how long ago the activity took place. </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/22075711437079" width="255" height="461"></p>
<p>You can collapse the view down to three activity cards and expand to see everything (up to 50 recent activities).</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/22075711451799" width="364" height="80"></p>
<h2 id="h_01HRZ59A41S2JJDPJXRQKRAPMA">Engaging with Activity Cards</h2>
<p>Want to ask a friend about that new game they’re playing? By selecting the activity cards, you can reply directly to the activity or even send them an emoji. In either case, this will send a direct message (<strong>DM</strong>) with a reference to the activity.</p>
<p> </p>

<h2 id="h_01HRZ59A41YF3GVZRBNZWXQVZK">Types of Activity Content</h2>
<p>Initially, the content shown within activity cards will reflect gaming activity, but over time, other types of activity will also be shown - including game achievements, Spotify, Crunchyroll, and more.</p>
<h2 id="h_01HRZ59A41W46PH064PDY7PWEZ">Activity Privacy</h2>
<p>If you want to prevent your activity from showing up in this feature, you can do so in two ways: 1) globally or 2) for a specific game.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Globally</strong></span></p>
<p>If you want to control whether <strong><em>any</em></strong> activity is shared, you can enable or disable your global settings in the <strong>Activity Privacy</strong> settings. </p>
<p>1. Head over to your <strong>User Settings </strong>by selecting the <strong>cogwheel </strong>[<img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/22075711510039" width="20" height="20">] in the bottom left corner.</p>
<p>2. Then under the <strong>Activity Settings</strong> section, select <strong>Activity Privacy</strong>. </p>
<p>3. From here, you can use the toggle to enable or disable <strong>Share Activity with Others</strong>.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/22075711534743" width="600" height="386"></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Specific Games</strong></span></p>
<p>Alternatively, if you just want to prevent a specific game from being shared, you can disable specific games through the <strong>Registered Games </strong>menu. </p>
<p>1. Head over to your <strong>User Settings </strong>by selecting the <strong>cogwheel </strong>[<img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/22075711562135" width="20" height="20">] in the bottom left corner.</p>
<p>2. Then under the <strong>Activity Settings </strong>section, select <strong>Registered Games</strong>.</p>
<p>3. From here, you can select the icon for <strong>Toggle Detection </strong>to prevent a game from showing up in the activity cards going forward.</p>
