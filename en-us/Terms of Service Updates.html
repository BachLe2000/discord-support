<p>Ah, the Terms of Service: everyone’s favorite thing to read. Below you’ll find a summary of the key updates, but please do read the full <a href="https://discord.com/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Terms of Service</a>, as they are what actually govern your use of Discord. The new terms go into effect on <strong>April 15, 2024</strong>.</p>
<p>Here are some highlights of what we updated:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Better description of our services.</strong> We added in more details on how Discord works – from how users communicate to features that highlight content or activity on Discord. </li>
<li>
<strong>Included Brand Guidelines. </strong>We love that you love Discord and we take pride in our logos and colors. So we included our <a href="https://discord.com/branding" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brand Guidelines</a> in the Terms so you know where to find newest and crispiest versions of our brand marks and what to do if you want to use them. </li>
<li>
<strong>More Transparency About How We Approach Safety and Content Moderation</strong>. We spent a lot of time this last year making it easier to understand our <a href="https://discord.com/guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Community Guidelines</a> and to explain many of our <a href="https://discord.com/safety-policies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">content and safety policies</a>. So we also wanted to help you understand how we learn about potential violations of those policies and what happens next if we take action against an account.</li>
<li>
<strong>Appeals. </strong>We added more information about how you can appeal the decisions we make and extra detail about how to submit appeals under the EU’s Digital Services Act. For our European users, your appeals need to be submitted within six months of the decision you want to challenge.</li>
<li>
<strong>Improved dispute resolution. </strong>We’ve updated our informal dispute resolution process and our arbitration agreement to lay out more detail on the steps you should take in case you have a dispute. We also made updates to comply with laws available to users who reside in the European Economic Area.</li>
