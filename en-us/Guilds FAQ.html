<h1 id="h_01HXW2MCD0W4NTT0TPARSDHHS0">What are Guilds?</h1>
<p>On Discord, a <strong>Guild</strong> is a small, exclusive server where people who regularly play games together collaborate, compete, and hang out.</p>
<p>Guilds recruit members by application and provide their members with a sense of tight-knit community, support, and shared identity.</p>
<div class="info-box">
<strong>Note</strong>: Guilds can only have a maximum of 200 members. This Guild member capacity cannot be increased at this time.</div>
<h1 id="h_01HXW2MCD0F03P7GE49RF9ZD4K">How to Create a Guild</h1>
<div class="exp-box">This feature is currently an experiment and only available to a select number of servers.</div>
<p>You can either create a Guild from scratch by creating a brand new server or converting your current server into a Guild.</p>
<p>If your server is currently in the experiment, you will see an option to convert your server as an in-app popup at the top-left of your app. Tap on <strong>Check it out</strong> to continue. </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/23478789909015" width="180" height="237"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/23478789922583" width="306" height="237"></p>
<p>1. Choose the game(s) you and your Guild play together. You can also change this later if you want to add more games or edit the current ones.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/23478777476631" width="624" height="536"></p>
<p>2. Select the playstyle of your Guild. You can choose between the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very Casual</li>
<li>Casual</li>
<li>Hardcore</li>
<li>Very Hardcore</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/23536776850967" width="610" height="524"></p>
<p>3. (<strong><em>Optional</em></strong>) Choose the type of demographic you want to recruit to your Guild.</p>
<p>Depending on the type of Guild you have, you can select ranks for a specific game, minimum ages, and more. Pick what best suits your Guild.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/23478777485207" width="624" height="536"></p>
<p>4. Tell people what your Guild talks about.</p>
<p>Does everyone have a <em>HUGE </em>love of cheesecake? Does everyone listen to k-pop while gaming?</p>
<p>Select at least 3 <strong>Traits</strong> for your Guild.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/23536770882967" width="620" height="532"></p>
<p>5. You can write the <strong>discovery description</strong> for your Guild.</p>
<p>Focus on why someone should join and what your Guild offers. You can also describe your Guild in 3 words here too. Be creative!</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/23536770889495" width="597" height="512"></p>
<p>6. Create a <strong>Guild tag</strong> and <strong>badge</strong> that members will wear all over Discord to rep your Guild.</p>
<p>Your Guild tag can be a max of 4 characters. However it is not unique and multiple Guilds can have the same tag. Once you select a badge, you can change the color to either one of the preset color schemes or use the color picker to customize. </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/23536770898071" width="594" height="510"></p>
<p>7. Customize your Guild brand even further by selecting a <strong>banner color scheme</strong> or using the eyedropper tool to pick 2 colors. You can also select the <strong>banner style</strong> and pick between the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Night Sky</li>
<li>Castle</li>
<li>World Map</li>
<li>Sea Foam</li>
<li>Warp</li>
<li>House</li>
<li>Pulsar</li>
<li>Mesh</li>
<li>Spatter</li>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/23536776893719" width="550" height="472"></p>
<p>8. Set up an application for users interested in joining your Guild.</p>
<p>You can include questions like, “why do you want to join this Guild?” Or “what’s your favorite dinosaur and why?” You can choose to make the responses be a short paragraph, a long paragraph, or multiple choice.</p>
<p>You must have at least one question set up to proceed.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/23536776910615" width="537" height="461"></p>
<p>9. Now you’re done! Sign the charter and your Guild is now created. Don’t forget to don your Guild tag!</p>

<h1 id="h_01HXW2MCD0BT70FB9SRV1YRPBV">How to Approve or Reject Applications</h1>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/23478777589911" width="624" height="456"></p>
<p>4. You can leave this tab anytime you are finished with reviewing applications.</p>
<h1 id="h_01HXW2MCD0DPVFR67AA96X0CDW">How to Join a Guild</h1>
<div class="exp-box">This feature is currently an experiment and only available to a select number of users.</div>
<p>There are 3 ways to join a Guild: Discovery tab, invite links, and guild tags.</p>
<h2 id="h_01HXW2MCD06PZ1G5EF9885R535">Discovery</h2>
<p>If you tap on the <strong>Discovery</strong> tab in your Discord app, you can see a list of available Guilds that you can apply to join. You can also set different preferences depending on what you are looking for in a Guild.</p>
<p>Once you find one you’d like to join, tap on the Guild and then fill out an application. You can join as many Guilds as you’d like!</p>
<h2 id="h_01HXW2MCD0E8MPCX184CSNCNM4">Invite Link</h2>
<p>Just like a server, an invite link can be created for a Guild to invite other users to join! </p>
<h2 id="h_01HXW2MCD08EDXFJ8G73FT3G4W">Guild Tag</h2>
<div class="exp-box">If you see the option <strong><span style="color: #434343;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Join Waitlist for Guilds</span></strong><span style="color: #434343;" data-darkreader-inline-color=""> instead of </span><strong><span style="color: #434343;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">Apply To Join</span></strong><span style="color: #434343;" data-darkreader-inline-color="">, this means that you do not have access to the experiment. You can only join the waitlist once and joining does not guarantee access to the experiment.</span>
</div>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/23478790049431" width="275" height="66"></p>
<p>If you see in a message or on someone’s profile a Guild you want to join, you can tap on the tag for the Guild and then tap on <strong>Apply To Join</strong> to pull up the application.</p>
<p>If your application has been approved, you’ll be added into that server for that Guild. If it’s been rejected, you’ll receive a notification stating so.</p>
