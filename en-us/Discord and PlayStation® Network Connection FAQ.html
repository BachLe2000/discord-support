<p><strong>Q: Why won't my Game Activity Status display correctly on Discord?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: You will have to check your PlayStation Network settings. Specifically, you need to set your </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">PSN Online Status</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now Playing</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> privacy settings to “Anyone” for your status to also be visible on Discord.

<p><strong>Q: Why won't my PlayStation Network status display when I'm streaming, listening to Spotify, or having a different game open on my computer?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: This is due to how the client interacts with presence from other devices and activities. In other words, what you do locally on your computer will always take priority for what you see as an Activity status. In addition, </span><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001557452" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rich presence</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will take priority over basic presence; which means the PlayStation Network integration won't display while you're also listening to Spotify or playing games which support rich presence.</span></p>
<h2 id="h_01GR8PJ3PXVP8XH0H3QMYB4P12">Voice Transfer to PS5</h2>
<p><strong>Q: I already linked my account for PlayStation Network to my Discord account. Do I have to re-link my PSN and Discord account again?</strong></p>
<p>A: If you’ve previously linked your Discord and PSN accounts, you’ll have to re-link them again in order to enable Discord Voice on PS5. If you participated in the beta for Discord voice chat on the PS5, you do not need to re-link your PSN account.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I’m getting an error message when I try to transfer Discord voice to my PS5.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: As an initial step, please make sure your console is up-to-date and to reset and reconnect your PSN/Discord accounts.
