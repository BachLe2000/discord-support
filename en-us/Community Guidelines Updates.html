<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor="">Our </span><a href="https://discord.com/guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Community Guidelines</a><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=""> are the foundation for how we work to keep you safe and ensure that Discord stays the best place to talk, hang out, and have fun with friends online.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;" data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor="">One of our main goals with today’s update to the Community Guidelines was to make our rules easier to understand. After each guideline, we’ve added a link to our </span><a href="https://discord.com/safety-policies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Policy Hub</a>, where we explain our policies in greater detail.</p>
<p>Below is a quick summary of two other important changes — but, please do read the full guidelines, as they actually govern your use of Discord. The changes go into effect on <strong>April 15, 2024</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>We’ve separated our doxxing and harassment guidelines.</strong> Previously, doxxing was combined with our harassment guideline. However, we consider these distinct harm types, so we separated them to better reflect how we organize our policies.</li>
<li>
<strong>We’ve created a new, “Follow the Law” section. </strong>In last year’s version of the Community Guidelines, we referenced multiple types of illegal behavior in a single guideline. Now, we’ve expanded that guideline into its own section, which allows us to more clearly explain how we assess dangerous and illegal behaviors.</li>
</ul>
