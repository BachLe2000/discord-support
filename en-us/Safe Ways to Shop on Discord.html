<p><strong>Q: How do you identify a third-party seller?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Third-party sellers are unauthorized individuals or websites that offer Discord products at discounted prices or through unofficial channels. These sellers often advertise through unsolicited messages, social media, or unofficial websites. To identify them, look for offers that require external payments, unusual URLs, or methods that don’t involve the Discord app or official Amazon store. Remember: if it’s not from a Discord source described in this article, it’s not official.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What does a phishing attempt look like?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Phishing attempts often appear as fake messages or links designed to trick you into providing sensitive information, like your login credentials or payment details. Common signs include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Messages claiming you’ve won or received free products or rewards, like Nitro, but requiring you to click a suspicious link.</li>
<li>Threats to your account status unless you take immediate action.</li>
<li>Requests for your password, account login, or personal information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Discord will never ask for your login details or for your payment information through unsolicited messages. Always verify links and contact <a href="https://dis.gd/contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord support</a> directly if you’re unsure.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What are safe messaging practices to avoid unsolicited scams?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> To protect yourself from unsolicited messages and scams:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid engaging with messages from unknown users, especially those offering deals or rewards.</li>
<li>Enable <strong>Safe Direct Messaging</strong> under <strong>User Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Safety</strong> to automatically scan DMs from non-friends for harmful content.</li>
<li>Report suspicious messages or users by following the steps outlined <a href="https://dis.gd/howtoreport" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</li>
