<p>Hello there! If you’ve been using Discord for a while now, you probably noticed the mobile app was designed to reflect the desktop app. With this new iteration of Discord on mobile, we hope to make the mobile experience feel like it was optimized for your mobile device rather than a scaled-down desktop app. The new mobile design aims to simplify and improve the Discord experience for everyone by creating a more organized, streamlined, and better-looking mobile app that helps you get to your chats quickly and easily. </p>
<p>We’re actively gathering feedback as we release this change to ensure that we continue to provide the best experience on Discord. For those of you who have already experienced previous iterations of our mobile app, thank you for all the thoughtful feedback you've shared with us so far! We've been paying great attention to it and it's helping us continue to make improvements. If you’re new to this version of the app, be sure to explore the new mobile experience and all that it has to offer. If something doesn’t work for you, please let us know so we can continue to improve! </p>
<p>This Help Center article will explain the core updates to the mobile app and how you can provide feedback and thoughts on what does or doesn’t work for you.</p>

<p>The <strong>Home</strong> <strong>tab</strong>, located in the bottom-left corner of the app, is where you can find all your servers and access your Direct Messages (<strong>DMs</strong>) and group chats.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/23613682265111" width="268" height="580"></p>
<p>Once you open the Home tab, you’ll see the <strong>Messages</strong> <strong>icon</strong> and all of your servers on the left of the screen. Tapping on the Messages icon will show all the DMs and group chats you’re part of. Tapping on a server will open it within the <strong>Servers</strong> <strong>tab</strong> and allow you to scroll through and open that server’s channels.</p>
<p>In each of your servers, you’ll be able to <strong>Favorite</strong> channels, use the search bar at the top of the server channel list to find messages and content in a server, and see the channel details of each server channel, which includes a list of the server members in that channel, the Media/Files/Links sent in that channel, the threads created, and more.</p>

<p>All notifications in the <strong>Notifications</strong> tab are actionable: Join an event, message someone who just accepted your friend request, etc. </p>
<p>You no longer need to click a notification for it to be considered read in the <strong>Notifications</strong> tab, just seeing it is enough. The next time you return to the <strong>Notifications</strong> tab, all read notifications will be de-emphasized and new notifications will be emphasized so you always know what’s new and don’t have to actively clear your notifications. </p>
<p>Red badges will persist on the <strong>Notifications</strong> tab when you have pending friend requests, and you must resolve your pending friend requests to clear them.</p>
<h1 id="h_01HFW7WQ05JN3Q3A722JW15WWN">You Tab</h1>
<p>The <strong>You</strong> tab is your dedicated space to view and customize how you appear to others on Discord. You can find the <strong>You</strong> tab in the bottom right corner of the app. From this tab, you can easily edit your profile, set your status, view your friends, or manage your settings. </p>

<p>App Settings are still in this tab and you can now access them by tapping the <strong>gear icon</strong> at the top right of the <strong>You</strong> tab. If you want to get to settings quickly, you can also double-tap the <strong>You</strong> tab icon at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>You can now search within <strong>Settings</strong>. It’s a small but mighty improvement. Now, you don't have to waste time scrolling through every single setting to find what you're looking for. Simply type in the search bar and watch the magic happen.</p>

<h1 id="h_01HFW7WQ05FDBEA08M5XF79M0G">Voice &amp; Video Calls</h1>

You must tap the <strong>Join Voice</strong> button to enter a voice call.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Why are you changing the mobile app layout?</strong></p>
<p>A: We’re always looking for ways to improve our users’ experience on Discord and a big part of this is making investments in improving and evolving the features available on mobile.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Are there iOS/OS or Discord app version requirements (ie. iOS 11.0+, Android 5.0+, Discord version 206+)?</strong></p>
<p>A: You must have the latest version of the Discord app to experience these updates. We also recommend that you have the latest version of your mobile device’s OS.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Where can I provide feedback?</strong></p>
<p>A: You can provide feedback by navigating to the <strong>You</strong> tab in the bottom right corner of the app → tapping the <strong>App Settings</strong> gear icon in the top right → selecting <strong>Appearance</strong> → scrolling to the <strong>New Layout</strong> section → and selecting <strong>Give us Feedback</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Were there any changes to the layout of the Settings page?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, the location has changed and we have added a search bar to <strong>Settings</strong>. You can find your <strong>Settings</strong> page in the <strong>You </strong>tab on the bottom right of the app via the gear icon in the top right of the <strong>You</strong> tab. If you want to get to settings quickly, you can also double-tap the <strong>You</strong> tab icon at the bottom of the screen to jump to <strong>Settings</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I go back to the original mobile app layout?</strong></p>
<p>A: We understand the change might take some getting used to, and we're here to help make that transition as smooth as possible for you. But with this update, the original mobile layout is no longer available.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will this be available for both Android and iOS users?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes.</p>
