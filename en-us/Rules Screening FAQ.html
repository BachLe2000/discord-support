<p id="docs-internal-guid-c30408bd-7fff-84f7-977a-36cb279e5b8a"><strong>Q: I currently use a role gating through a third-party bot to have members agree to rules should, I use this instead?</strong></p>
<p>A: We recommend switching to our Rules Screening because in order to DM or talk in the server, members must agree to the rules. Existing bot gates do not protect against DMs to server members and are confusing for new members. If you are worried about moderation or safety, you can enable Automod and Raid Protection.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I don't currently use role gating on my server. Should I set up rules screening now?</strong></p>
<p>A: If you would like new members to explicitly agree to rules, Rules Screening is an easy way to set it up. However, do note that it will add another step to joining your server which can sometimes lead to a drop off in joiners.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Are there other types of membership screening capabilities?</strong></p>
<p>A: Rules screening is currently our only available membership screening capability.</p>
