<h1 id="h_01HCMKZTFV6PHAF5025FK7Q15Z"><strong>What is Krisp?</strong></h1>
<p>Krisp is a 3rd party machine learning, noise filtration software that runs on your device. Krisp is able to remove background noise much better than traditional solutions, letting you have clear conversations even in busy environments!</p>
<p>Krisp is also a stand alone app. You can learn more about their company and software specifically on their website <a href="https://api.krisp.ai/v2/resource/link/discord" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="h_01HCMKZTFV4ASVS1MFW3XECSF5"><strong>What does Krisp do on Discord?</strong></h2>
<p>We’ve integrated Krisp to improve our voice call experience even further. By toggling on Krisp we use machine learning to remove background noises that aren’t human voices such as dogs barking, vacuums, or doors slamming while still passing through your voice.</p>

<h2 id="h_01HCMKZTFVN55MD43MKFRM9YFS"><strong>Am I passing any information to Krisp when I turn it on?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do not pass any information or data to Krisp when you enable the tech on Discord. This means that no voice, user, video or any data is ever sent or shared outside of Discord. The machine learning model runs on your device to cancel out noise - no data is ever sent to Krisp's servers under any circumstances.</span></p>
<h1 id="h_01HCMKZTFVVJ9DSTE86SVR2HBQ"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additional Frequently asked questions</span></h1>
<p><strong>Q: How much does it cost? </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: Krisp is free when you use it with Discord. If you want to use it outside of Discord in other apps, you can check out their pricing <a href="https://api.krisp.ai/v2/resource/link/discord" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</span></p>
<p><strong>Q: Will Krisp filter noises for other people on the call when I have it on?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: No. Krisp will only filter noises coming from your side. So if your friends do not have it toggled on you may still hear their background noise. </span></p>
<p><strong>Q: When should I use Krisp?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: Krisp works best in environments where there is a lot of non-human voice background noise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because Krisp works to process out background noises if you are in a quiet environment and have a high-quality mic you may notice a decline in voice quality. If you’re in a quiet environment where you don’t need noise filtration we would encourage you to continue using voice chat without Krisp. </span></p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I use Krisp on video calls?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: Yes! Krisp can also be used on audio for video calls as well.</span></p>
<p><strong>Q: Will Krisp work for Go Live?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: Yes! Krisp can be used when you are using the voice channel in Go-Live stream. </span></p>
<p><strong>Q: Does Krisp work on mobile?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: As of 7/27/20 Krisp will be available on mobile devices.</span></p>
<p><strong>Q: If I toggle on Krisp in one voice chat will it toggle on in all other voice chats?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: Yes. Once you toggle on Krisp it will be active for any new voice chats until you toggle it back off again.</span></p>
