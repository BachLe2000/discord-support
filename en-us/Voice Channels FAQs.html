<h1 id="h_01HGXJWRPAM7ZBDKJ75B0NWQ4G">What are Voice Channels?</h1>
<p>A voice channel is a channel in a server where users can connect and chat with one another. You can always tell what channel is a voice channel versus a text channel because a voice channel will be indicated by a speaker icon [<img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/19583605640471" width="20" height="18">].</p>

<p>There are 2 ways to create a voice channel in a server. Let’s go over both!</p>
<p><strong>Option 1</strong></p>
<p>1. First, tap on the plus (+) next to a channel category in the Discord server you want to make the new channel in.</p>
<p>2. Then tap on <strong>Voice </strong>and enter a name for the new channel.</p>
<p>3. Tap on <strong>Create Channel</strong> when you’re ready to create the channel.</p>
<p>4. Congratulations! You now have a new voice channel in your server. If you want to move the channel, you can drag and drop the channel to another category. </p>

<p><strong>Option 2</strong></p>
<p>1. Right-click on the channel list in the Discord server you want to make the new channel in.</p>
<p>2. Then tap on <strong>Voice </strong>and enter a name for the new channel.</p>
<p>3. Tap on <strong>Create Channel</strong> when you’re ready to create the channel.</p>
<p>4. Congratulations! You now have a new voice channel in your server. Creating the channel this way will position the voice channel at the very top, so you can drag and drop the voice channel to move it to a category.</p>

<h2 id="h_01HGXJWRPA55H4PRWCP622JNJJ">Role permissions for adding a Voice Channel</h2>
<p>In order to create voice channels in the Discord server, you either need to be the Server Owner or have Moderator permissions set up. Here’s how to set up role permissions so your Moderators can also create channels.</p>
<p>1. Navigate to the server that you want to change settings for then tap on the server name in the top-left corner of the app.</p>
<p>2. Tap on <strong>Server Settings </strong>and then head to <strong>Roles</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Now tap on the role that you wish to edit.</p>
<p>4. Finally, tap on the <strong>Permissions</strong> tab and locate the <strong>Manage Channels</strong> permission. If enabled, this role will be able to delete and create text and voice channels. A check mark indicates the setting is enabled, an x means it’s disabled for this role.</p>
