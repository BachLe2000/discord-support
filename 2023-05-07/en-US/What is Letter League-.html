<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Letter League is an <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/4422142836759" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Activity</a> that we've developed here at Discord. Letter League is a game where you and your friends take turns placing letters on a shared game board to create words in a crossword-style. Spelling words with high earning letters and placing letters on special spaces earn players more points, so get your dictionaries and thesauri ready!</span></p>

<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: Why is Discord adding games into voice channels?</strong></span></p>
<p>A: We started Discord because we are all about bringing people together around gaming. As Discord has grown, we've seen more and more people use Discord to come together around games. For instance, we’ve seen people use Discord to not only play <em>League</em> but also to hang out and play more casual, social games with friends like <em>Jackbox</em> and <em>Among Us</em>.</p>

<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: Is there an age requirement?</strong></span></p>
<p>A: There is no age requirement for Letter League.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: How do I play?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: To start a game, first join one of the voice channels. Once there, you should see the Activity Launcher (it looks like a rocket ship) in the voice channel controls. Click the Activity Launcher to open the Activity Shelf, " and then select "Letter League".'</span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>Q: Where can I report bugs and problems with the game?</strong></span></p>

<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Q: How do I view/delete my Activities on Discord data? What data is tracked?</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: You can view data for Discord-developed Activities like <em>Letter League</em> through the <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/360004027692" target="_self">Discord Privacy and Safety settings</a>. </span><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">To enhance the gameplay experience, Letter League accesses and temporarily stores the following user data once a user joins the Activity:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discord ID</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avatar</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Username</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">User data is stored so long as the Activity remains active, even if the user leaves the Activity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once all users leave the Activity and it is determined the Activity has ended, the user data is deleted and no longer retained by Letter League</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Q: Didn’t Letter League used to have a different name?</span></strong><br>A: Letter League used to be listed as Letter Tile. As part of our regular updates to Activities on Discord, we gave Letter League a glow-up and the name change was part of that effort.<br></span></p>
