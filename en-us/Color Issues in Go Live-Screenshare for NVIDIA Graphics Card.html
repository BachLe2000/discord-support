<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-e8e0ddc1-7fff-0d88-27b5-1c91b405cf72">On October 20, 2023, we investigated a stream discoloration issue that occurred during screensharing in Discord for Windows users with the latest NVIDIA GPU driver, version 545.84. The outgoing stream can exhibit a loss in color values, creating a wash out image as you see below. This is a possible video encoder regression in NVIDIA’s 545.84 driver.</span></p>

<p id="docs-internal-guid-1bda2486-7fff-48aa-bf4a-dffd7c94dfc1">Our team is working with NVIDIA for a fix of this color issue. If you are impacted by this issue,  <strong>we recommend reverting to NVIDIA driver version 537.58 or below as that should resolve the discoloration in your Go Live stream</strong>.</p>
