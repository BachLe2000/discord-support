<h1 id="h_01H4RH0TQ9QG1NWKD08MVCTS4K"><strong>Why is a Server Labeled As Age-Restricted?</strong></h1>
<p>Our <a href="https://discord.com/guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Community Guidelines</a> require that all adult content posted to Discord be kept behind an age-restricted gate.</p>
<p>Server owners can designate <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000084051" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">specific channels as being 18+ by adding an age-restricted gate. Entire servers can now be classified as 18+ through the use of an </a><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500005389362" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">age-restricted server designation</a></p>
<p>Servers must be classified as age-restricted if the community is organized around age-restricted themes or if the majority of the server’s content is focused on 18+ content.</p>
<h2 id="h_01H4RH13HQJNMSFPDA9KGDVJB5"><strong>I can’t view or join Age-Restricted servers. What should I do?</strong></h2>
<p>If you are between the ages of <strong>13</strong> and <strong>17</strong>, you will not be able to join or view the content in age-restricted servers. For people aged<strong> 18 and older</strong>, age-restricted servers can only be joined on desktop or Android devices.</p>
<p>Those with iOS devices are required to "opt-in on desktop" in order to view age-restricted servers from their iOS device.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-x-large"><strong>How to opt in for iOS:</strong></span></p>
<p>1. <span id="docs-internal-guid-4fc6651a-7fff-4c6d-6405-c19b8ebe6b2a" style="color: #2e3338;">Sign in to Discord on desktop and navigate to your <strong>User Settings</strong>. You can find your User Settings by selecting the <strong>cogwheel</strong> [<img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/20361142823319" width="20" height="20">]  icon in the bottom left corner of the app.<br></span></p>
<p>2. In the User Settings menu, <span id="docs-internal-guid-442403a2-7fff-8fa3-c3be-2e5842316ef8" style="color: #2e3338;">select <strong>Privacy &amp; Safety</strong>.<br></span></p>
<p>3. <span id="docs-internal-guid-12f9b902-7fff-be0c-2401-93448b02a384" style="color: #2e3338;">Enable <strong>Allow access to age-restricted content on iOS</strong> by pressing the toggle. This will let you view age-restricted servers you are already a member of from your iOS device.<br></span></p>
<p>Additionally, a subset of age-restricted servers that are specifically focused on explicit pornographic content will be blocked entirely on iOS. </p>
<ul>
<li>iOS users aged 18+ will only be able to join and access these dedicated pornography servers on the desktop and web versions of Discord.</li>
</ul>
<div class="info-box">
<strong>Note</strong>: Only age-restricted server owners and moderators will be allowed to view and manage this specific subset of age-restricted servers on iOS.</div>
<h2 id="h_01H4RH1GSQF4689C1VVX9CGHGV"><strong>How do I update my age information?</strong></h2>
