<h1 id="h_01FB7GSDX29HY45M5SCMK2YBYK">What is Sketch Heads?</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sketch Heads is an <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/4422142836759" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Activity</a> that we've developed here at Discord. In Sketch Heads, players sketch pictures of a word prompt to get others to guess the prompt correctly.</span></p>
<h3 id="h_01HRAXGTQYYBBQ505HZNKW7DPA">Note: ⚠There is no way to moderate drawings, so be sure to establish boundaries with your fellow players. </h3>

<h2 id="docs-internal-guid-0feb0d7a-7fff-3d9a-7c28-a9da68f7c4b2">Game Modes</h2>
<p>After launching the game, you can choose between 3 different game modes. Here is a breakdown of each game mode: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Classic:</strong> A competitive battle against your friends where you take turns choosing a secret word to draw while everyone else competes to guess it as fast as possible!</li>
<li>
<strong>Blitz: </strong>A chaotic, cooperative race against the clock where you split into two teams, Drawers and Guessers. Drawers share a canvas and rapidly draw words while the Guessers guess as many as possible before the time runs out.</li>
<li>
<strong>Free Draw:</strong> A canvas where you can sketch freely with friends or solo. You can share these drawings outside the Activity!</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have decided to play either Classic or Blitz, the <strong>Game Setup </strong>menu will appear and allow you to select the length and theme of the game.</p>
<h3 id="docs-internal-guid-004670e3-7fff-5a32-f760-92e831c20414">
<span style="color: #434343;">In Sketch Heads, the first person to start the activity becomes the </span><strong><span style="color: #434343;">host</span></strong><span style="color: #434343;"> and has the ability to select the game mode.</span>

<p id="docs-internal-guid-d8919426-7fff-154c-ab73-07db2a0c5360">2. Once the game begins, the Drawers will be given a series of secret words where they will have to do their best to sketch. </p>
<p>While drawing, you can use the following tools to help sketch your creation: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Color Picker</strong>: Choose a color from the list or open the color picker by selecting the multi-colored sphere. </li>

As a Guesser, you can guess as many times as you would like until you have discovered the secret word or time has run out.</p>

<h1 id="h_01F4ZHYENSF3VFJR8BEMF8ZPC2">Sketch Heads FAQ</h1>
<p><strong>Q: Why is Discord adding games into voice channels?</strong></p>
<p>A: We started Discord because we are all about bringing people together around gaming. As Discord has grown, we've seen more and more people use Discord to come together around games. For instance, we’ve seen people use Discord to not only play <em>League</em> but also to hang out and play more casual, social games with friends like <em>Jackbox</em> and <em>Among Us</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Is there an age requirement?</strong></p>
<p>A: There is no age requirement for Sketch Heads. </p>
<p><strong>Q: How do I play?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: To start a game, first join one of the voice channels. Once there, you should see the Activity Launcher (it looks like a rocket ship) in the voice channel controls. Click the Activity Launcher to open the Activity Shelf, " and then select "Sketch Heads".'</span></p>
<p><strong>Q: How many players can play Sketch Heads?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: There can be more than 20 players within a game. However, you may experience some technical issues. We recommend games up to 16 players for the best experience. <strong> </strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Q: Where can I report bugs and problems with the game?</strong></p>
<p>A: You'll be able to submit a bug report by going to <a href="https://dis.gd/bugreport" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://dis.gd/bugreport</a></p>

<p><strong>Q: How do I view/delete my Activities on Discord data? What data is tracked?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: You can view data for Discord-developed Activities like <em>Sketch Heads</em> through the <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/360004027692" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord Privacy and Safety settings</a>. </span><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">To enhance the gameplay experience, Sketch Heads accesses and temporarily stores the following user data once a user joins the Activity:</span></p>
<ul>

<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avatar</span></li>

</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">User data is stored so long as the Activity remains active, even if the user leaves the Activity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once all users leave the Activity and it is determined the Activity has ended, the user data is deleted and no longer retained by Sketch Heads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Q: Didn’t Sketch Heads used to have a different name?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A: Sketch Heads used to be listed in Activities on Discord as Doodle Crew. As part of our regular updates to Activities on Discord, we gave Sketch Heads a glow-up and the name change was part of that effort.<br></span></p>
