<p>However, if a gifted item has not been claimed and added to your collection, it is possible that you may receive the same gifted item again. If this is the case, you can choose to claim one of the gifts. Then, the other gifts with the same item will be returned to the sender within 48 hours, and they can choose to send the gift to someone else.</p>
