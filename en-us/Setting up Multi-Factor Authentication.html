<h1 id="h_01J5BFD166FYKB7EDH6ASATZHT"><span style="color: #2e3338;">Types of Multi-Factor Authentication</span></h1>
<p><span style="color: #2e3338;">There are three options to add MFA to your account: Security Keys, an Authenticator App, and SMS. You can choose any one of these options or any combo, but there are positives and negatives to each. We’ll talk through each option and give you some info on the security of each one.</span></p>
<h2 id="h_01J5BFTAREYNK7KR2AG82SBEA0">Security Keys</h2>
<p><span style="color: #2e3338;">This is the latest in personal security, and also the most secure! With Security Keys, you’ll be able to use a passkey (ex. FaceId, TouchId, Windows Hello) to gain access to your account. The way this works is when you register a passkey for Discord, you’ll protect it using your biometric (fingerprint or face) and the key itself lives on your device and in your provider’s cloud (e.g. Apple/Microsoft). Whenever you want to use the passkey, you authenticate using your biometric so that your device sends the passkey data to Discord. And to be clear, we’re never given any biometrics data from your device.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #2e3338;">This method is the best way to protect your account because it is simple to use, on your own devices, backed up in the cloud, and, most importantly, phishing resistant.</span></p>
<h2 id="h_01J5BFF3MARKSYE1QZ0XPEYXK2">Authenticator App</h2>
<p>The Authenticator App is an excellent choice that mixes flexibility with security. Plus the name makes us think we’re in a spy novel. With an Authenticator App, you’ll register a QR code or manually enter a key with an app on your phone or a password manager and then generate a new code for you to use every 30 seconds.</p>
<p>As long as you have your phone or access to your password manager, you can make new codes and hackers will have a hard time getting access to your app. But these codes are still phishable, so if you lose your phone, this could lead to a predicament.</p>
<h2 id="h_01J5BFF7HC5PSG3NBP3TYCQ8PB">SMS/Texts</h2>
<p>This is a common option. If we can be transparent with you, SMS MFA is better than no MFA, but not by a lot. Hackers have been able to intercept text messages or call up phone carriers to do a “SIM Swap” attack and take over phone numbers.</p>
<p>Since you can only use SMS if you already have an Authenticator App enabled, you should really think carefully about whether it’s worth adding a more easily stolen MFA after setting up a better option with your Authenticator App. Either way, there’s always…</p>
<h2 id="h_01J5BFFW7Q5A7H6TKDX4JDKEWQ">Backup Codes</h2>
<p>What happens when the worst case scenario happens? You’ve registered your security key, but your laptop’s been stolen; or configured your Authenticator, but lost your phone. How can you regain access to your account? With Backup codes!</p>
<p>Backup codes are special, random codes we give you after signing up for MFA. Keep these secret and well-protected. We recommend storing them in a password manager (like 1Password, or KeePas[XC]), but you can also print them out and hide them if you’d prefer.</p>
<p>If you are locked out of your account and need to get past MFA, you can use one of these codes in order to recover and reconfigure your account. Each code can only be used once, so once your account is under your control again with new MFA configured, generate some new codes and hide them away safely again.</p>

<p><span style="color: #2e3338;">You can now register another Security Key on this device or a different device (you can have up to 16 at the same time). If you’re adding a Security Key on another device and it’s asking for an MFA code, but you’ve only registered Security Keys on other devices, remember you can always use a Backup Code to get the process going, then regenerate them to get a fresh set once you’re all done.</span></p>
